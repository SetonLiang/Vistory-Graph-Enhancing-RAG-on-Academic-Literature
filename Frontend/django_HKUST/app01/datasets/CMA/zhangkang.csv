2020,Automation in Construction 119,Generating layout designs from high-level specifications,"Xiao-Yu Wang, Kang Zhang",Xiao-Yu Wang,English,"This paper presents a framework for the automatic generation of floor plans based on adjacency relations among rooms. The adjacency can be generated from user-specified design requirements using a graph grammar formalism. We propose a set of grammar rules to generate graphs that represent adjacency relationships. Our solution overcomes the limitation of previous approaches that generate only rectangular floor plans. We define a set of constraints, such as plan size, room orientation and aspect ratio, for specifying the desired floor plans; and present a set of algorithms for placing rectangular or non-rectangular rooms and for generating non-rectangular floor plan boundaries. We demonstrate that our method can generate varied floor plans from user-specified design requirements.",Article,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580520301199,28,wang2020generating,None
2020,Journal of Visualization 23,The influence of font scale on semantic expression of word cloud,"Lu Yang, Jie Li, Wenhuan Lu, Yi Chen, Kang Zhang, Yan Li",Lu Yang,English," Abstract Word cloud is a common text visualization technique. With the ability of presenting the keywords of a document in a direct way, it has been widely applied in many real-world situations. However, to better represent the main idea of a document, a critical aspect for word cloud design is to set an appropriate font size to facilitate semantic expression. In this paper, we explore the influence of font scale on semantic expression and evaluate font size of word cloud in a more systematic approach. To quantify semantic information of a document, we utilize an LDA ensemble-based method to support interactive selection of topics and obtain the semantics of documents in a scientific way. We conducted two pilot studies to decide important attributes of word clouds for the formal study. Through formal study 1, we find that the scale affects the semantic expression of word cloud, including accuracy, time and confidence in?…",Article,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12650-020-00678-3,26,yang2020influence,"Visualization,Word cloud ,Semantic expression,LDA ensemble-based method"
2022,The Visual Computer,Visual complexity of shapes: a hierarchical perceptual learning model,"Lingchen Dai, Kang Zhang, Xianjun Sam Zheng, Ralph R Martin, Yina Li, Jinhui Yu",Lingchen Dai,English," Understanding how people perceive the visual complexity of shapes has important theoretical as well as practical implications. One school of thought, driven by information theory, focuses on studying the local features that contribute to the perception of visual complexity. Another school, in contrast, emphasizes the impact of global characteristics of shapes on perceived complexity. Inspired by recent discoveries in neuroscience, our model considers both local features of shapes: edge lengths and vertex angles, and global features: concaveness, and is in 92% agreement with human subjective ratings of shape complexity. The model is also consistent with the hierarchical perceptual learning theory, which explains how different layers of neurons in the visual system act together to yield a perception of visual shape complexity.

2020,Journal of Computer Languages 58,Parametric modeling and generation of mandala thangka patterns,"Jiajing Zhang, Kang Zhang, Ren Peng, Jinhui Yu",Jiajing Zhang,English,"The mandala thangka, as a religious art in Tibetan Buddhism, is an invaluable cultural and artistic heritage. However, drawing a mandala pattern of thangka style is both time- and effort-consuming and requires mastery due to intricate details. Retaining and digitizing this heritage is an unresolved research challenge to date. In this paper, we propose a parametric approach to model and generate mandala thangka patterns to address this issue. Specifically, we construct parameterized models of three stylistic elements used in the interior mandalas of Nyingma school in Tibetan Buddhism according to their geometric features, namely the star, crescent, and lotus flower motifs. Varieties of interior mandala patterns are successfully generated using these parameterized motifs based on the hierarchical structures observed from hand-drawn mandalas.

2020,The Computer Journal,A graph grammar approach to the design and validation of floor plans,"Xiao-Yu Wang, Yu-Feng Liu, Kang Zhang",Xiao-Yu Wang,English," Researchers have proposed many approaches to generate floor plans using shape grammars. None of them, however, testifies the semantic relations among rooms. This paper presents a generic approach for grammar specification, grammar induction, validation, and design generation of house floor plans using their path graphs based on the reserved graph grammar (RGG) formalism. In our approach, the connectivity of a floor plan is analyzed by user-specified graph grammar transformation rules, also known as productions. Floor plans of houses in different styles share common attributes while retaining specific features. By identifying these features, our approach validates floor plans in different styles with user-specified graph productions. A graph grammar induction engine is also introduced to assist designers by automatically inferring graph productions from an input graph set.

This research measures white space, color complexity and stroke density in Chinese ink paintings and examines how these attributes influence the paintings’ perceived complexity. Empirical evidence from 21 well-known modern Chinese artists’ ink paintings shows that white space decreases paintings’ complexity, while chromatic space and stroke density increase complexity. We also reveal that a large rate of white space guides the viewers’ attention on chromatic space and enhances the impacts of color complexity and stroke density on perceived complexity. An eye-tracker measures viewers’ elaboration duration on each painting, which provides consistent evidence to validate our conclusion based on subjective reported visual complexity.

2020,The Visual Computer 36,Interactive influences of color attributes on color perception bias,"Huan Yang, Yi-Na Li, Kang Zhang",Huan Yang,English," Graphic user interfaces and information visualization use color to represent qualitative or quantitative information. The interaction between adjacent colors leads to perceptual bias, known as simultaneous color contrast, and implicitly distort the understanding of visualized information presentation. To investigate the effect of simultaneous color contrast, we conduct two empirical experiments, in both theoretical and application settings, using a set of random target/proximal combinations of colors in the CIEL*a*b* color space. The perception bias of a target color, induced by its surround, is measured. Linear regression analysis indicates that both a high saturation of the proximal color and a high a*/low b* value of the target color cause a strong simultaneous color contrast (i.e., high perception bias). A moderating effect analysis indicates that a* value/b* value of the target color moderates the influence of the?…",Article,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-019-01706-6,7,yang2020interactive,"Color perception,Perception bias,Simultaneous color contrast,Visualization"

However, existing image search methods heavily rely on proximity measurements like tag matching or image similarity, requiring precise user inputs for satisfactory results. To meet the growing demand for a contemporary image search engine that enables accurate comprehension of users' search intentions, we introduce an innovative user intent expansion framework. Our framework leverages visual-language models to parse and compose multi-modal user inputs to provide more accurate and satisfying results. It comprises two-stage processes: 1) a parsing stage that incorporates a language parsing module with large language models to enhance the comprehension of textual inputs, along with a visual parsing module that integrates an interactive segmentation module to swiftly identify detailed visual elements within images; and 2) a logic composition stage that combines multiple user search intents into a unified logic expression for more sophisticated operations in complex searching scenarios. Moreover, the intent expansion framework enables users to perform flexible contextualized interactions with the search results to further specify or adjust their detailed search intents iteratively. We implemented the framework into an image search system for NFT (non-fungible token) search and conducted a user study to evaluate its usability and novel properties. The results indicate that the proposed framework significantly improves users' image search experience.

Its objective is to promote bodily engagement with the painting (i.e., embedded body embodiment and its movement and interaction) to enhance the audience's experience, while maintaining its essence. Unlike two-dimensional interactions, this approach constructs the Painterly Reality by capturing the audience's body embodiment in real-time and embedding into a three-dimensional painterly world derived from a given painting input. Through their body embodiment, the audience can navigate the painterly world and play with the magical realism (i.e., interactive painterly objects), fostering meaningful experiences via interactions. The Painterly Reality is subsequently projected through an Augmented Reality Mirror as a live painting and displayed in front of the audience. Hence, the audience can gain enhanced experiences through bodily engagement while simultaneously viewing and appreciating the live painting. The paper implements the proposed approach as an interactive artwork, entitled ""Everyday Conjunctive,"" with Fong Tse Ka's painting and installs in a local museum, which successfully enhances audience experience through bodily engagement.",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01067,0,zhou2023painterly,"dockless bike-sharing, origin-destination data, metaphor, visualization"
2023,Journal of Visualization,"Comparing color usage in abstract, oil, and Chinese ink paintings","YuFan Li, ZhenBao Fan, YiXuan Zhu, Christine Yan, Kang Zhang",YuFan Li,English,"Color is one of the fundamental elements of paintings. This paper proposes a set of measurements for color usage in a painting, including basic color elements, global and local color harmony, and color statistical properties, characterizing color features from both the spatial domain and frequency domain. We also collect a painting set including 1059 abstract paintings, 1012 oil paintings, and 1003 Chinese ink paintings. Applying the measurements to this painting set, we are able to observe the roles of color in the three genres of paintings. We report our findings in detail on the effectiveness of these measurements. Chinese ink paintings are significantly different from abstract and oil paintings in color usage, while abstract paintings emphasize color more than the two other genres. The measurements may serve as tools for the classification of paintings. The work is the first of this kind and points to further?…",Article,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12650-023-00929-z,0,li2023comparing,"Aesthetics assessment,Color harmony,Color evaluation,Computational aesthetics,Paintings"
2023,arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.13770,Archiving Body Movements: Collective Generation of Chinese Calligraphy,"Aven Le Zhou, Jiayi Ye, Tianchen Liu, Kang Zhang",Aven Le Zhou,English,"As a communication channel, body movements have been widely explored in behavioral studies and kinesics. Performing and visual arts share the same interests but focus on documenting and representing human body movements, such as for dance notation and visual work creation. This paper investigates body movements in oriental calligraphy and how to apply calligraphy principles to stimulate and archive body movements. Through an artwork (Wushu), the authors experiment with an interactive and generative approach to engage the audience's bodily participation and archive the body movements as a compendium of generated calligraphy. The audience assumes the role of both writers and readers; creating (""writing"") and appreciating (""reading"") the generated calligraphy becomes a cyclical process within this infinite ""Book,"" which can motivate further attention and discussions concerning Chinese characters and calligraphy.",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13770,0,zhou2023archiving,"Body Movement, Bodily Engagement, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Painterly Content, Interactive Art, Generative Art, AI-Generated Painterly Content."

2023,Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Visual Information?…,Kandinsky's Color-Shape Associations in Chinese Context: Do Personality and Affect Matter?,"Zixu Gong, Kang Zhang, Rongrong Chen",Zixu Gong,English,"Inspired by Kandinsky's original postulation of specific color-shape association preferences in human beings (i.e., blue circle, red square and yellow triangle), extensive literature from diverse cultural backgrounds has re-examined this issue and achieved a consensus on the existence of such preferences, yet there is disagreement on the specific association patterns. In this study, we investigated the association between color and basic geometric shapes among Chinese college students. Correspondence analysis revealed that both circles and triangles are highly associated with yellow. Circles are also associated with red, while squares exhibit a strong association with blue. Additionally, we confirmed Kandinsky's theory that the angular characteristics of shapes affect the choice of warm and cold colors assigned to them. Interestingly, neither personality traits nor affect states affect the color-shape association?…",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3615522.3615531,0,gong2023kandinsky,"Chinese Comic Painting, FONG Tse Ka, Bodily Engagement, Bodily Movement, Body Embodiment, Interactive Art"
2023,Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Visual Information?…,Urban Symphony: An AI and Data-Driven Approach to Real-Time Animation for Public Digital Art,"Rem RunGu Lin, Yongen Ke, Kang Zhang",Rem RunGu Lin,English," Projection mapping is a form of urban public art that uses light and video to transform buildings and structures into dynamic canvases. However, producing high-quality projection mapping content with compelling storytelling requires extensive time and resources, as it involves integrating local culture, urban spatial understanding, and animation production. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method that combines artistic co-creation with AI, audio-visualization, and data-visualization techniques. The authors present a case study: “Urban Symphony,” an immersive public art installation that showcases our method and leverages AI and data-driven storytelling. This method fosters interdisciplinary research collaboration and explores the potential of projection mapping as a bridge between art, technology, and society.

2023,Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Visual Information?…,Metaphor Design of Dockless Bike-sharing Based on Spatio-temporal Geographic Data,"Kelin Li, Hong Yin, Dong Li, Kang Zhang, Changbo Wang",Kelin Li,English," Dockless Bike-sharing systems can be treated as a typical paradigm of the sharing economy. Due to the indiscriminate use and placement of huge bikes, their scheduling rules are complicated, which poses a challenge to the macro-control of the companies To enhance the information dimension of bike Origin-Destination (OD) data, an algorithm based on grid features is proposed to reconstruct travel trajectories of OD data. This paper starts by analyzing and designing metaphors to describe the scheduling rules and trip characteristics of Dockless Bike-Sharing. The evaluation shows that the proposed metaphors are user-friendly to novice users. We argue that metaphors provide an effective way for users to understand abstract ideas in a visual design with a large dataset.",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3615522.3615534,0,li2023metaphor,"dockless bike-sharing, origin-destination data, metaphor, visualization"

To address this, we present BiverWordle, a novel tool that reveals the relationship between market sentiment and firm trends. BiverWordle integrates candlestick chart, ThemeRiver, and Wordle with text classification and sentiment analysis techniques to decode market dynamics from textual sources, such as shareholder opinions and firm announcements. With the application of a Voting model to the manually labeled data, we achieved an accuracy of approximately 64%. BiverWordle facilitates the extraction of shareholder insights from sparse comments and provides a visual method for historical stock trend analysis, which we validated with three distinct stock trends.

2023,Leonardo,Interactive moiré patterns Reflecting on the traditional nanjing baiju,"Ye Yang, Guangxi Chen, Mengqi Li, Kang Zhang",Ye Yang,English," This article presents a human-machine design approach to the artistic and metaphorical representation of the traditional weaving scenes featured on Yunjin brocade as interactive moiré patterns accompanied by Nanjing Baiju performance. After extracting the basic elements of the eye-shaped moiré patterns, the authors systematically recomposed them to mimic the weaving process. They then wrote an algorithm to generate moiré patterns that respond dynamically to the unique sounds weavers make while weaving, symbolizing the gazes and eye contacts among the weavers. This became an interactive sonic installation, Sweating Weaving Room, which represents the rhythmic machine sounds, the Nanjing Baiju, and the hard labor and harmonious work hidden behind the glamorous brocade.",Article,https://direct.mit.edu/leon/article-abstract/56/1/10/113451,0,yang2023interactive,None
