However, conventional resonant-type linear energy harvesters usually operate within high and narrow frequency bands, which cannot match the frequencies of many vibration sources. If the excitation frequency deviates a bit from the natural frequency of an energy harvester, the energy harvesting performance will deteriorate drastically. Because of the ultra-low frequency characteristic, it is challenging to reliably harvest energy from the ambient vibrations. To address this mismatching issue, the ultra-low frequency ambient vibrations are converted into high-frequency oscillations using certain mechanical mechanisms, which are termed frequency up-conversion techniques. This paper reviews the existing approaches that can realize frequency up-conversion for enhancing energy harvesting from low-frequency vibration sources. According to their working mechanisms, the existing methods are classified into three categories: impact-based, plucking-based, and snap-through-based approaches. The working principles of the three approaches are explained in detail. Representative designs from all categories are reviewed.

This paper presents a piezoelectric metamaterial with the capability of broadband vibration attenuation by adaptive bandgap tuning. Unlike the widely used synthetic impedance circuit, a self-tuning resonant shunt circuit by integrating a microcontroller-driven digital potentiometer into the synthetic inductor circuit is developed to achieve the bandgap adjustment of the piezoelectric metamaterial. Specifically, the excitation frequency is detected by the microcontroller, and the synthetic inductance in the resonant shunt circuit is adjusted in real-time based on a given criterion. An experimental study is conducted to demonstrate the dynamic behavior and vibration suppression performance of the developed piezoelectric metamaterial. The results confirm that the self-tuning resonant shunt circuit …",Conference paper,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12483/124831F/Piezoelectric-metamaterial-with-self-tuning-resonant-shunt-circuits/10.1117/12.2657612.short
2021,Active and Passive Smart Structures and Integrated Systems XV 11588,A topological-metamaterial-based vibration energy harvester,"Chunbo Lan, Guobiao Hu, Lihua Tang",Chunbo Lan,English,"Topological metamaterial has become a research hotspot recently, owing to the unique features, including wave localization and topological protection. In this paper, we are motivated to introduce the topological metamaterial into vibration energy harvesting. The proposed topological metamaterial vibration energy harvester (topological meta-VEH) consists of two topologically different sub-metamaterials and a piezoelectric transducer mounted at the conjunction of these two sub-metamaterials. First, the governing equations of this electromechanical system are derived. Then, the band structure and dispersion relation of this topological meta-VEH is obtained by applying the Bloch theory. To obtain the transmittance response, the finitely long model of the proposed topological meta-VEH is formulated, the corresponding analytical solutions are obtained as well. From the theoretical analysis, it is found that the …",Conference paper,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11588/115881F/A-topological-metamaterial-based-vibration-energy-harvester/10.1117/12.2584066.short
2020,Active and Passive Smart Structures and Integrated Systems XIV 11376,Power and electromechanical coupling of nonlinear piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters,"Chunbo Lan, Yabin Liao, Guobiao Hu, Lihua Tang",Chunbo Lan,English,"In the past decade, nonlinearity has been introduced into piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEH) for power performance enhancement and bandwidth enlargement. While a great emphasis has been placed on the structural design and the effect of electrical part on the nonlinear dynamics of the system, the maximum power and power limit, an important aspect for performance optimization of nonlinear PEHs, are rarely studied, especially their relationship with that of linear PEHs. To this end, this paper is motivated to investigate the maximum power and power limit of a representative type of nonlinear PEHs, i.e., monostable. An equivalent circuit is proposed to analytically study and explain the behaviors of monostable PEHs, and reveals the connection between linear and monostable PEHs. The effect of nonlinearity, e.g., due to the additional magnetic force, is modeled as a nonlinear stiffness element mechanically …",Conference paper,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11376/113761I/Power-and-electromechanical-coupling-of-nonlinear-piezoelectric-vibration-energy-harvesters/10.1117/12.2557872.short
