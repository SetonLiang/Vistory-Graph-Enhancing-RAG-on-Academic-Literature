In this letter, we study an IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) system where a base station (BS) with multiple antennas arranged in a uniform rectangular array (URA) serves a single-antenna user with the help of an IRS with multiple elements arranged in a URA. We consider a Rician fading model, where the non-line of sight (NLoS) components vary slowly and the line of sight (LoS) components do not change. To reduce costs for channel estimation and phase adjustment, we adopt fixed maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) at the BS, fixed phase shifts at the IRS and constant rate transmission.
