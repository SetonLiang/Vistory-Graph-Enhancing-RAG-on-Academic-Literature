2020,Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications …,Everything is a race and nakamoto always wins,"Amir Dembo, Sreeram Kannan, Ertem Nusret Tas, David Tse, Pramod Viswanath, Xuechao Wang, Ofer Zeitouni",Amir Dembo,English,"Nakamoto invented the longest chain protocol, and claimed its security by analyzing the private double-spend attack, a race between the adversary and the honest nodes to grow a longer chain. But is it the worst attack? We answer the question in the affirmative for three classes of longest chain protocols, designed for different consensus models: 1) Nakamoto's original Proof-of-Work protocol; 2) Ouroboros and SnowWhite Proof-of-Stake protocols; 3) Chia Proof-of-Space protocol. As a consequence, exact characterization of the maximum tolerable adversary power is obtained for each protocol as a function of the average block time normalized by the network delay. The security analysis of these protocols is performed in a unified manner by a novel method of reducing all attacks to a race between the adversary and the honest nodes.",,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3372297.3417290

Proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols are an energy efficient alternative; however existing protocols adopting Nakamoto's longest chain design achieve provable security only by allowing long-term predictability, subjecting the system to serious bribery attacks. In this paper, we prove that a natural longest chain PoS protocol with similar predictability as Nakamoto's PoW protocol can achieve security against any adversary with less than 1/(1+e) fraction of the total stake. Moreover we propose a new family of longest chain PoS protocols with a formal proof of their security against a 50% adversary, while only requiring short-term predictability.",,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3560829.3563559
2021,Financial Cryptography and Data Security: 25th International Conference,Blockchain cap theorem allows user-dependent adaptivity and finality,"Suryanarayana Sankagiri, Xuechao Wang, Sreeram Kannan, Pramod Viswanath",Suryanarayana Sankagiri,English,"  Longest-chain blockchain protocols, such as Bitcoin, guarantee liveness even when the number of actively participating users is variable, i.e., they are adaptive. However, they are not safe under network partitions, i.e., they do not guarantee finality. On the other hand, classical blockchain protocols, like PBFT, achieve finality but not adaptivity. Indeed, the CAP theorem in the context of blockchains asserts that no protocol can simultaneously offer both adaptivity and finality. We propose a new blockchain protocol, called the checkpointed longest chain, that offers individual users the choice between finality and adaptivity instead of imposing it at a system-wide level. This protocol’s salient feature is that it supports two distinct confirmation rules: one that guarantees adaptivity and the other finality. The more optimistic adaptive rule always confirms blocks that are marked as finalized by the more conservative rule …",,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-64331-0_5
2021,Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications …,Securing parallel-chain protocols under variable mining power,"Xuechao Wang, Viswa Virinchi Muppirala, Lei Yang, Sreeram Kannan, Pramod Viswanath",Xuechao Wang,English,"Several emerging proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain protocols rely on a ''parallel-chain'' architecture for scaling, where instead of a single chain, multiple chains are run in parallel and aggregated. A key requirement of practical PoW blockchains is to adapt to mining power variations over time (Bitcoin's total mining power has increased by a 1014 factor over the decade). In this paper, we consider the design of provably secure parallel-chain protocols which can adapt to such mining power variations. The Bitcoin difficulty adjustment rule adjusts the difficulty target of block mining periodically to get a constant mean inter-block time. While superficially simple, the rule has proved itself to be sophisticated and successfully secure, both in practice and in theory. We show that natural adaptations of the Bitcoin adjustment rule to the parallel-chain case open the door to subtle, but catastrophic safety and liveness breaches.

Existing solutions to boost the trust using a stronger blockchain, eg, via checkpointing, requires the weaker blockchain to give up sovereignty. In this paper we propose a family of protocols in which multiple blockchains interact to create a combined ledger with boosted trust. We show that even if several of the interacting blockchains cease to provide security guarantees, the combined ledger continues to be secure–our TrustBoost protocols achieve the optimal threshold of tolerating the insecure blockchains. Furthermore, the protocol simply operates via smart contracts and require no change to the underlying consensus protocols of the participating blockchains, a form of “consensus on top of consensus”. The protocols are lightweight and can be used on specific (eg, high value) transactions; we demonstrate the practicality by implementing and deploying TrustBoost as cross-chain smart contracts in the Cosmos ecosystem using approximately 3,000 lines of Rust code, made available as open source. Our evaluation shows that using 10 Cosmos chains in a local testnet, TrustBoost has a gas cost of roughly $2 with a latency of 2 minutes per request, which is in line with the cost on a high security chain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.",,https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1428
2022,Proceedings of the 2022 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications …,Minotaur: Multi-resource blockchain consensus,"Matthias Fitzi, Xuechao Wang, Sreeram Kannan, Aggelos Kiayias, Nikos Leonardos, Pramod Viswanath, Gerui Wang",Matthias Fitzi,English,"Resource-based consensus is the backbone of permissionless distributed ledger systems. The security of such protocols relies fundamentally on the level of resources actively engaged in the system. The variety of different resources (and related proof protocols, some times referred to as PoX in the literature) raises the fundamental question whether it is possible to utilize many of them in tandem and build multi-resource consensus protocols. The challenge in combining different resources is to achieve fungibility between them, in the sense that security would hold as long as the cumulative adversarial power across all resources is bounded. In this work, we put forth Minotaur, a multi-resource blockchain consensus protocol that combines proof of work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS), and we prove it optimallyfungible.

2023,arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.06955,Security analysis of Filecoin's expected consensus in the Byzantine vs honest model,"Xuechao Wang, Sarah Azouvi, Marko Vukolić",Xuechao Wang,English,"Filecoin is the largest storage-based open-source blockchain, both by storage capacity (>11EiB) and market capitalization. This paper provides the first formal security analysis of Filecoin's consensus (ordering) protocol, Expected Consensus (EC). Specifically, we show that EC is secure against an arbitrary adversary that controls a fraction  of the total storage for , where  is a parameter that corresponds to the expected number of blocks per round, currently  in Filecoin. We then present an attack, the -split attack, where an adversary splits the honest miners between multiple chains, and show that it is successful for , thus proving that  is the tight security threshold of EC. This corresponds roughly to an adversary with  of the total storage pledged to the chain. Finally, we propose two improvements to EC security that would increase this threshold.

These services are offered largely in a traditional web2.0 format (e.g., OpenAI's GPT4 service). As more large AI models proliferate (personalizing and specializing to a variety of domains), there is a tremendous need to have a neutral trust-free platform that allows the hosting of AI models, clients receiving AI services efficiently, yet in a trust-free, incentive compatible, Byzantine behavior resistant manner. In this paper we propose SAKSHI, a trust-free decentralized platform specifically suited for AI services. The key design principles of SAKSHI are the separation of the data path (where AI query and service is managed) and the control path (where routers and compute and storage hosts are managed) from the transaction path (where the metering and billing of services are managed over a blockchain). This separation is enabled by a ""proof of inference"" layer which provides cryptographic resistance against a variety of misbehaviors, including poor AI service, nonpayment for service, copying of AI models. This is joint work between multiple universities (Princeton University, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Tsinghua University, HKUST) and two startup companies (Witness Chain and Eigen Layer).",,https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16562
2024,arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.09005,Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security,"Zishuo Zhao, Zhixuan Fang, Xuechao Wang, Yuan Zhou",Zishuo Zhao,English,"Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from  to . Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma.

2024,arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.10890,Thinking Fast and Slow: Data-Driven Adaptive DeFi Borrow-Lending Protocol,"Mahsa Bastankhah, Viraj Nadkarni, Xuechao Wang, Chi Jin, Sanjeev Kulkarni, Pramod Viswanath",Mahsa Bastankhah,English,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing and lending platforms are crucial to the decentralized economy, involving two main participants: lenders who provide assets for interest and borrowers who offer collateral exceeding their debt and pay interest. Collateral volatility necessitates over-collateralization to protect lenders and ensure competitive returns. Traditional DeFi platforms use a fixed interest rate curve based on the utilization rate (the fraction of available assets borrowed) and determine over-collateralization offline through simulations to manage risk. This method doesn't adapt well to dynamic market changes, such as price fluctuations and evolving user needs, often resulting in losses for lenders or borrowers. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive, data-driven protocol for DeFi borrowing and lending. Our approach includes a high-frequency controller that dynamically adjusts interest rates to maintain market stability and competitiveness with external markets. Unlike traditional protocols, which rely on user reactions and often adjust slowly, our controller uses a learning-based algorithm to quickly find optimal interest rates, reducing the opportunity cost for users during periods of misalignment with external rates. Additionally, we use a low-frequency planner that analyzes user behavior to set an optimal over-collateralization ratio, balancing risk reduction with profit maximization over the long term. This dual approach is essential for adaptive markets: the short-term component maintains market stability, preventing exploitation, while the long-term planner optimizes market parameters to enhance profitability and reduce risks.

2024,arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.02615,"TetraBFT: Reducing Latency of Unauthenticated, Responsive BFT Consensus","Qianyu Yu, Giuliano Losa, Xuechao Wang",Qianyu Yu,English,"This paper presents TetraBFT, a novel unauthenticated Byzantine fault tolerant protocol for solving consensus in partial synchrony, eliminating the need for public key cryptography and ensuring resilience against computationally unbounded adversaries. TetraBFT has several compelling features: it necessitates only constant local storage, has optimal communication complexity, satisfies optimistic responsiveness -- allowing the protocol to operate at actual network speeds under ideal conditions -- and can achieve consensus in just 5 message delays, which outperforms all known unauthenticated protocols achieving the other properties listed. We validate the correctness of TetraBFT through rigorous security analysis and formal verification. Furthermore, we extend TetraBFT into a multi-shot, chained consensus protocol, making a pioneering effort in applying pipelining techniques to unauthenticated protocols. This positions TetraBFT as a practical and deployable solution for blockchain systems aiming for high efficiency.",,https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02615
2023,arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.09123,Raft-Forensics: High Performance CFT Consensus with Accountability for Byzantine Faults,"Weizhao Tang, Peiyao Sheng, Pronoy Roy, Xuechao Wang, Giulia Fanti, Pramod Viswanath",Weizhao Tang,English,"Crash fault tolerant (CFT) consensus algorithms are commonly used in scenarios where system components are trusted, such as enterprise settings. CFT algorithms offer high throughput and low latency, making them an attractive option for centralized operations that require fault tolerance. However, CFT consensus is vulnerable to Byzantine faults, which can be introduced by a single corrupt component. Such faults can break consensus in the system. Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms withstand Byzantine faults, but they are not as competitive with CFT algorithms in terms of performance. In this work, we explore a middle ground between BFT and CFT consensus by exploring the role of accountability in CFT protocols. That is, if a CFT protocol node breaks protocol and affects consensus safety, we aim to identify which node was the culprit. Based on Raft, one of the most popular CFT algorithms, we present Raft-Forensics, which provides accountability over Byzantine faults. We theoretically prove that if two honest components fail to reach consensus, the Raft-Forensics auditing algorithm finds the adversarial component that caused the inconsistency. In an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that Raft-Forensics performs similarly to Raft and significantly better than state-of-the-art BFT algorithms. With 256 byte messages, Raft-Forensics achieves peak throughput 87.8% of vanilla Raft at 46% higher latency, while state-of-the-art BFT protocol Dumbo-NG only achieves 18.9% peak throughput at nearly  higher latency.",,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09123
2023,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Scalable and fungible blockchain consensus via proof of resource,Xuechao Wang,Xuechao Wang,,"Built on the pioneering work of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a permissionless blockchain operating on proof-of-work based on the Nakamoto longest chain protocol. However, the scalability of Bitcoin is unsatisfactory: it has large energy consumption and uncompetitive performance. Consequently, designing scalable blockchains has garnered significant interest from both academia and industry. One avenue of exploration has involved replacing proof-of-work with more energy-efficient alternatives, such as proof-of-stake and proof-of-space. However, the security of these alternative systems remain poorly understood. Concurrently, several emerging proof-of-work blockchain protocols employ a “parallel-chain” architecture to scale performance, where instead of a single chain, multiple chains operate in parallel and are subsequently aggregated. However, the practicality of these proposals has yet to be demonstrated. Furthermore, improving blockchain security has emerged as a major research direction. One promising approach involves the fungible combination of various consensus mechanisms, resources, or blockchains. Fungibility is an essential attribute of these combinations, as it ensures that the system’s security is not solely dependent on one single consensus mechanism, resource, or blockchain. In this dissertation, we conduct a thorough study of the challenges involved in designing scalable and fungible blockchain consensus via proof of resource. Specifically, we investigate the following topics: i) analyzing the security of Bitcoin and its energy-efficient alternatives; ii) improving the scalability and practicality of Prism, a recently proposed …",,https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/127505
