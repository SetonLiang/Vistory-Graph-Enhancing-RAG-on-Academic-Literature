2020,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,AUV-aided localization of underwater acoustic devices based on Doppler shift measurements,"Zijun Gong, Cheng Li, Fan Jiang, Jun Zheng",Zijun Gong,English,"The autonomous underwater vehicle(AUV)-aided localization techniques for underwater acoustic devices show promising applications in many scenarios, and most researches in this area are based on the time of arrival (ToA) or the time difference of arrival (TDoA) measurements. However, these measurements are not readily available. To develop a more universally applicable scheme, we investigate the possibility of employing the Doppler shift measurements for underwater localization of acoustic devices in this paper. To be specific, we employ a low-complexity algorithm for Doppler estimation, and prove that the estimation error can be well approximated by zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Based on the Doppler estimates, we can obtain a series of nonlinear equations. To solve them, we propose a two-phase linear algorithm to obtain high-accuracy position information of the target devices.

2021,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,An adaptive asynchronous wake-up scheme for underwater acoustic sensor networks using deep reinforcement learning,"Ruoyu Su, Zijun Gong, Dengyin Zhang, Cheng Li, Yuanzhu Chen, Ramachandran Venkatesan",Ruoyu Su,English,"Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWSNs), acting as a reliable and efficient infrastructure of the Internet of underwater things (IoUT), have attracted much research interest in recent years due to the wide range of their potential marine applications. The limited energy supply of underwater sensor nodes is a significant challenge that can be mitigated by the cyclic difference set (CDS)-based coordination asynchronous wake-up scheme. However, the CDS-based asynchronous wake-up scheme also introduces long delays in the neighbor discovery that deteriorates packet delay as well as the network lifetime. In this paper, we formulate the problem of policy selection for idle listening as a Markov decision process and exploit the framework of deep reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal policies of underwater sensor nodes. Furthermore, the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are utilized to estimate the …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9337228/
2020,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,A machine learning-based approach for auto-detection and localization of targets in underwater acoustic array networks,"Zijun Gong, Cheng Li, Fan Jiang",Zijun Gong,English,"The localization and tracking of underwater objects have many applications. In a proactive underwater sensor array, some nodes will periodically broadcast linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals, which will hit the targets, get reflected and received by the other nodes. Depending on the target's position and velocity, the received signals will also be LFM signals of different frequencies and frequency rates. We can use the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) to analyze the received signal's spectrum and find the peak. Based on the location of the peak, the target's distance and radial velocity can be estimated. However, the accuracy is highly dependent on the sampling interval of the spectrum. Smaller sampling interval leads to higher accuracy but also induces considerable complexity. To overcome this issue, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect the existence of the target, and …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9250694/
2020,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,Data-aided Doppler compensation for high-speed railway communications over mmWave bands,"Zijun Gong, Cheng Li, Fan Jiang, Moe Z Win",Zijun Gong,English,"Millimeter wave communications show great potentials in many applications, one of which is the high-speed railway(HSR) communication system. However, a major challenge is the Doppler effect caused by the relative-movement between the train and the base station (BS), which leads to fast channel variation. To compensate for the Doppler shift, an accurate channel model is indispensable, and the far-field channel model is generally employed, which assumes that the dimensions of the antenna arrays are negligible compared to the distance between transmitter and receiver. This model is widely used in Cellular systems, but the underlining assumption is not always true for railway communication systems. In this paper, the modeling of the Doppler effect for millimeter wave in HSR communications is conducted, and data-aided Doppler estimation and compensation algorithms are designed based on the new …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9210206/
2020,Mobile Networks and Applications 25,An enhanced AUV-aided TDoA localization algorithm for underwater acoustic sensor networks,"Kun Hao, Kaicheng Yu, Zijun Gong, Xiujuan Du, Yonglei Liu, Lu Zhao",Kun Hao,English," Since localization now has been an essential step in underwater work. The traditional localization algorithm, like time different of arrival (TDoA) has been proposed for its efficiency in terrestrial while it cannot perform perfect because of the unstable propagation in the harsh underwater environment. And autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been used in many circumstances to meet the needs of underwater works. Hence, an enhanced AUV-aided TDoA localization algorithm (EATLA) for underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) is proposed. The AUV dives into the predefined depth from the water surface after acquiring its position coordinates through the GPS, and periodically transmits data packets around the unknown node. After the unknown node receives the data packets and calculates its position, the conditions for the unique result and evaluate the reliability are quantified.

2020,IEEE Wireless Communications Letters,Analysis of the underwater multi-path reflections on Doppler shift estimation,"Zijun Gong, Cheng Li, Fan Jiang",Zijun Gong,English,"For underwater target localization and tracking, accurate Doppler shift estimation is very important. In this letter, the analysis of the multi-path effect on Doppler shift estimation accuracy is conducted for the narrow-band acoustic underwater channels. We conducted comprehensive analysis on the performance of a widely used low-complexity Doppler estimation algorithm, and showed that the mean square estimation error decreases with sample length quadratically. Then we derived the Cramér-Rao lower bound, which also decreases quadratically with sample length. As a result, we concluded that the impact of multi-path effect is negligible for a sampling length of several seconds.

A challenging problem introduced by the use of large antenna size and wide bandwidth is beam squint, i.e., spatial-wideband effect. Beam squint can significantly degrade the channel estimation performance for conventional channel estimators. Research effort on channel estimation under beam squint conditions has been very limited. For the few available work that attempts to address this problem, they require either all subcarriers or multiple symbols used as pilot for channel estimation, so large overhead becomes inevitable. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation method that only requires a small number of subcarriers.

The wide use of tensor-based approaches highlights the limitation of matrix-based methods and has generated increasing needs in multidimensional data analytics. Driven by such demands, tensor decomposition with automatic rank determination has recently emerged as a promising tool for image processing, wireless communications and neural network compression. However, unlike the success in matrix-based schemes of exploring the correlation for performance improvement, existing tensor-based methods fail to consider the correlation structure in the tensor.

To that end, the novel orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been developed as a promising physical-layer transmission technique, evident by the outstanding performance in terms of robustness against time-frequency selective fading over the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterpart. However, when OTFS meets massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), the specific conditions, under which the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel model holds, are not identified.

Doppler effect becomes more predominant in the underwater environment when the relative speed of the moving object, i.e., the observer, to the signal propagation speed in water is much larger than that in the air. This along with the observer-target geometry will bring in a notable impact on the localization performance. In this article, we derive the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) and formulate the A-optimality criterion-based observer trajectory optimization problem to improve the localization performance based on time delay and Doppler shift measurements. We show that in the worst case scenario, there will be a conflict between the nonaccessible zone constraint and the observer dynamics constraint, which will lead to an erroneous result.

For the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band in 6G, both the Doppler and the spatial wideband effects can lead to channel variation in time and space domains, respectively.

Specifically, we will focus on the search of an underwater target that can constantly broadcast a beacon signal, such as a black box. Common measurements for localization are Doppler shift [1], time of arrival (ToA) [2]–[4], time difference of arrival (TDoA) [5], [6], angle of arrival (AoA) [7], etc. In this paper we will investigate the fundamental limits of Doppler shift-Based, ToA-Based, TDoA-based underwater localization. Note that AoA is not covered, because Doppler shift can be viewed as one type of AoA. The discussion will focus on short-baseline positioning with a mobile anchor, i.e., an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Due to the large distance and the limited battery life of the AUV, the target is quite likely to lie outside the convex hull of the AUV's trajectory. In such cases, we will show that accurate localization is …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10153725/

The positioning system for WSN is particularly meaningful and widely used in the military surveillance, air-sea rescue, traffic monitoring, and etc. However, the traditional positioning system always suffers from deployment and maintenance of anchors. In this paper, we propose a positioning system employing a Raspberry Pi platform attached to a DJI drone as a mobile anchor. The DJI drone can serve as multiple virtual anchors by moving and broadcasting its location information periodically. Thus, it is possible to localize sensor node by itself when the sensor node collects the drone's position. A Gauss-Newton method is applied to improve the accuracy of the proposed positioning system.

2024,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Unsynchronized Underwater Localization with Isogradient Sound Speed Profile and Anchor Location Uncertainties,"Haiyan Zhao, Zijun Gong, Jing Yan, Cheng Li, Xinping Guan",Haiyan Zhao,English,"Precise underwater localization has been very challenging due to the unsynchronized clock, stratification effect, and anchor location uncertainties. Although some localization methods have been proposed, they are all based on very strong and certain impractical assumptions, such as perfect time synchronization, constant underwater sound speed, or absolutely accurate anchor location information. In this paper, we investigate the underwater localization problem under more realistic conditions. By jointly considering the isogradient underwater sound speed profile (SSP) and anchor location uncertainties, an unsynchronized localization algorithm based on time-differenceof-arrival (TDoA) measurements will be presented.

The motions of the target, transmitter and receiver result in their real locations to be different from the initial locations during every observation period. Knowing that the measurement model is related to the locations, neglecting the motion effect will bring model bias, especially when the motion speeds are significant relative to underwater sound speed. Incorporating the motion effect into the measurement model to address the model bias problem will introduce the unknown real locations to make the tracking problem challenging. We shall transform the unknown real locations to be expressions with respect to the target state by solving their corresponding quadratic equations.

2023,ICC 2023-IEEE International Conference on Communications,Joint doppler and direction of arrival (DOA) based underwater localization with a mobile anchor,"Cheng Li, Zijun Gong, Xueheng Tao",Cheng Li,English,"For underwater localization, mobile anchors are generally preferred because they are easy to deploy and retrieve, such as the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, a big disadvantage is that we can only install small sonar arrays on AUVs due to their limited size. This leads to poor angular domain resolution. On the other hand, the mobility makes it possible for us to capture multiple snapshots of the acoustic signals when the AUV is located at different positions, and synthesize a virtual array, i.e., the Doppler effect. In this case we can equivalently obtain a large virtual uniform planar array (UPA), which gives much higher spatial resolution and positioning accuracy. Mathematically, we have not only the DoA (Direction of Arrival) measurements, but also the Doppler shift measurements for positioning.

2024,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,High Accuracy AUV-Aided Underwater Localization: Far-Field Information Fusion Perspective,"Ruoyu Su, Zijun Gong, Cheng Li, Shuai Han",Ruoyu Su,English,"An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can be employed to estimate an underwater target's position using the Doppler shift measurement extracted from received signals. Conventionally, the received signals have to be divided into several short frames so that the Doppler shift is constant in each one. When the AUV is far away from the target, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is quite low. An intuitive solution is to increase the frame length to suppress noise and boost SNR. However, it is worth noting that the Doppler shift is actually changing over time, and the prolonged frame length will inevitably induce modeling error. This is a fundamental dilemma in the Doppler-shift-based underwater localization. In this paper, we reveal that the assumption of constant Doppler shift comes from the zero-th order Taylor expansion of the real-time model.

2021,Memorial University of Newfoundland,Mobile node-aided localization and tracking in terrestrial and underwater networks,Zijun Gong,Zijun Gong,,"In large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the position information of individual sensors is very important for many applications. Generally, there are a small number of position-aware nodes, referred to as the anchors. Every other node can estimate its distances to the surrounding anchors, and then employ trilateration or triangulation for self-localization. Such a system is easy to implement, and thus popular for both terrestrial and underwater applications, but it suffers from some major drawbacks. First, the density of the anchors is generally very low due to economical considerations, leading to poor localization accuracy. Secondly, the energy and bandwidth consumptions of such systems are quite significant. Last but not the least, the scalability of a network based on fixed anchors is not good. Therefore, whenever the network expands, more anchors should be deployed to guarantee the required performance. Apart from these general challenges, both terrestrial and underwater networks have their own specific ones. For example, realtime channel parameters are generally required for localization in terrestrial WSNs. For underwater networks, the clock skew between the target sensor and the anchors must be considered. That is to say, time synchronization should be performed together with localization, which makes the problem complicated. An alternative approach is to employ mobile anchors to replace the fixed ones. For terrestrial networks, commercial drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are very good choices, while autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can be used for underwater applications.
