To facilitate transceiver design in hybrid mmWave mMIMO, acquiring an accurate channel state information is critical. To this end, a novel doubly-sparse approach is proposed to estimate doubly-selective mmWave channels under hybrid mMIMO. Via the judiciously designed training pattern, the well-utilized beamspace sparsity alongside the under-investigated delay-domain sparsity that mmWave channels exhibit can be jointly exploited to assist channel estimation. Thanks to our careful two-stage (random-probing and steering-probing) design, the proposed channel estimator possesses strong robustness against the double (frequency and time) selectivity whilst enjoying the benefits brought by the exploitation of double sparsity.

In order to balance the processing complexity and the design flexibility, we adopt a prevalent hybrid precoding technique named hybrid block diagonalization (HBD) for downlink multi-user transmission. Aimed at maximizing the end-to-end mutual information (EEMI), a novel virtual EEMI assisted two-stage HBD scheme is judiciously devised. Apart from a low implementing complexity, the developed scheme is a more generic HBD solution, as it not only takes the frequency selectivity into account, but also removes the reliance on the high-resolution analog network.

User identification attacks consist of one of the most critical privacy concerns on mobile big data. In this paper, we study mobile privacy in terms of user identifiability from the perspective of privacy adversaries. User identification in two datasets from the same data source or two different data sources is generally formulated as a linear assignment problem (LAP), in which the cost matrix of users is generated by a single distance measure. However, user identification via one single distance measure may lead to a large portion of false matches, especially when only a few users coexist across these two datasets.

To fully inherit its advantages and overcome its unfeasibility to mmWave hybrid massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) systems, a novel hybrid PSM (hPSM) is carefully proposed. Except for a similar digital design, hPSM distinctly differs from PSM for its dependence on the analog part of the mmWave mMIMO transceivers. Moreover, unlike PSM where the relevant design suffices to be restricted on a single subcarrier, hPSM requires joint consideration across all subcarriers.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven fault localization strategy based on multi-level system regionalization and the quantification of fault detection results in all subsystems/subregions. This strategy relies on the tree segmentation criterion to divide the entire system under study into several subregions, and then combines Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to find the confidence level of fault detection in each subregion in terms of their corresponding p-values. By comparing the p-values, one can accurately localize the faults.
