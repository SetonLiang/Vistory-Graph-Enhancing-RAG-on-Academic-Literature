2020,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,Online combinatorial auctions for resource allocation with supply costs and capacity limits,"Xiaoqi Tan, Alberto Leon-Garcia, Yuan Wu, Danny HK Tsang",Xiaoqi Tan,English,"We study a general online combinatorial auction problem in algorithmic mechanism design. A provider allocates multiple types of capacity-limited resources to customers that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each customer has a private valuation function on bundles of resources that she can purchase (e.g., a combination of different resources such as CPU and RAM in cloud computing). The provider charges payment from customers who purchase a bundle of resources and incurs an increasing supply cost with respect to the totality of resources allocated. The goal is to maximize the social welfare, namely, the total valuation of customers for their purchased bundles, minus the total supply cost of the provider for all the resources that have been allocated. We adopt the competitive analysis framework and provide posted-price mechanisms with optimal competitive ratios.

Mobile-edge computing provides a promising solution by allowing IoT devices to offload their computation to nearby edge servers to enable fast and energy-efficient data processing. In this article, we study a scenario, where two IoT users (IoT devices) offload their computation workloads to an edge server with hybrid nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission. The hybrid multiple access transmission incorporates three offloading methods, namely, hybrid NOMA, pure NOMA, and pure OMA.

2023,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,FedFA: Federated learning with feature anchors to align features and classifiers for heterogeneous data,"Tailin Zhou, Jun Zhang, Danny HK Tsang",Tailin Zhou,English,"Federated learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without exchanging their data, thus preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, it suffers significant performance degradation due to heterogeneous data at clients. Common solutions involve designing an auxiliary loss to regularize weight divergence or feature inconsistency during local training. However, we discover that these approaches fall short of the expected performance because they ignore the existence of a  vicious cycle  between feature inconsistency and classifier divergence across clients. This  vicious cycle  causes client models to be updated in inconsistent feature spaces with more diverged classifiers. To break the  vicious cycle , we propose a novel framework named  Fed erated learning with F eature A nchors  (FedFA).

Upon arrival, each EV requests a certain amount of energy. This request should be fulfilled before the EV’s departure. It is of critical importance to coordinate the EVs’ charging rates to smooth out the load profile of the parking lot because inappropriate charging rates can lead to sharp spikes and fluctuations on the load profile, imposing negative effects on the power grid. Meanwhile, empirical studies show that many parking lots exhibit statistical patterns on EV dynamics. For example, the bulk of EVs arrives during rush hours. Therefore, in this article, we incorporate such patterns into charging rate coordination. Although the statistical patterns can be summarized from historical data, they are difficult to be analytically modeled. As a result, we adopt a model-free deep reinforcement learning approach.

By battery swapping, EVs first replace their depleted batteries (DBs) with fully charged ones, and then, the demounted DBs can be recharged in charging facilities in a stand-alone mode, leading to a decouple between batteries and EVs during refueling. This article targets the planning and operation of a network of geographically distributed BSSs, termed BSS-Net. In particular, we focus on two important decisions being made within two different timescales, namely, a long-term decision on planning the initial inventory in each individual BSS and a short-term decision on real-time vehicle-to-station (V2S) routing of EVs.

In this setting, a single supplier allocates capacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and arbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act selfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request. The supplier charges payment from agents whose requests are satisfied, but incurs a load-dependent supply cost. The goal is to design an incentive compatible online mechanism, which determines not only the resource allocation of each request, but also the payment of each agent, so as to (approximately) maximize the social welfare (i.e., aggregate valuations minus supply cost). We study this problem under the framework of competitive analysis.

Our approach considers both coherent and non-coherent OSTBC so that systems with and without channel state information can be considered. To allow the application of OSTBC, we develop an approximate linearized and normalized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model for the AmBC system.

To shed light on this issue, we first visualize the loss landscape of FL over client and global models to illustrate their geometric properties. The visualization shows that the client models encompass the global model within a common basin, and interestingly, the global model may deviate from the basin's center while still outperforming the client models.

However, in most existing pruning methods, surviving neurons are randomly connected in the neural network without any structure, and the non-zero weights within each neuron are also randomly distributed. Such irregular sparse structure can cause very high control overhead and irregular memory access for the hardware and even increase the neural network computational complexity.

2023,arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.16923,Mode connectivity and data heterogeneity of federated learning,"Tailin Zhou, Jun Zhang, Danny HK Tsang",Tailin Zhou,English,"Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to train a model while keeping their data private collaboratively. Previous studies have shown that data heterogeneity between clients leads to drifts across client updates. However, there are few studies on the relationship between client and global modes, making it unclear where these updates end up drifting. We perform empirical and theoretical studies on this relationship by utilizing mode connectivity, which measures performance change (i.e., connectivity) along parametric paths between different modes. Empirically, reducing data heterogeneity makes the connectivity on different paths more similar, forming more low-error overlaps between client and global modes.

2023,,FedFA: Federated learning with feature alignment for heterogeneous data,"ZHOU Tailin, Jun Zhang, Danny Tsang",ZHOU Tailin,English,"Federated learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without exchanging their data, thus preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, it suffers significant performance degradation under heterogeneous data at clients. Common solutions involve designing specific regularizers for local-model training or developing aggregation schemes for global-model aggregation. Nevertheless, we found that these methods fail to achieve the desired performance due to neglecting the importance of feature mapping consistency across client models. We first observe and analyze that, with heterogeneous data, a vicious cycle exists between classifier divergence and feature mapping inconsistency across clients, thereby shifting the aggregated global model from the expected optima. We then propose a simple yet effective framework named Federated learning with Feature Alignment (FedFA) to tackle the data heterogeneity problem from a novel perspective of shared feature space. A key insight of FedFA is introducing feature anchors to align the feature mappings and calibrate the classifier updates across clients during their local updates, such that client models are updated in a shared feature space. We prove that this modification brings a property of consistent classifier updates if features are class-discriminative. Extensive experiments show that FedFA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on various image classification datasets under both label and feature distribution skews.",Conference paper,https://openreview.net/forum?id=BSZN74xLdqn

To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market.

In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility.
