2021,Journal of Sound and Vibration 508,Structural identification with physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations,"Zhilu Lai, Charilaos Mylonas, Satish Nagarajaiah, Eleni Chatzi",Zhilu Lai,English,"This paper exploits a new direction of structural identification by means of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), particularly constrained by domain knowledge, such as structural dynamics, thus forming Physics-informed Neural ODEs, aiming at governing equations discovery/approximation. Structural identification problems often entail complex setups featuring high-dimensionality, or stiff ODEs, which pose difficulties in the training and learning of conventional data-driven algorithms who seek to unveil the governing dynamics of a system of interest. In this work, Neural ODEs are re-casted as a two-level representation involving a physics-informed term, that stems from possible prior knowledge of a dynamical system, and a discrepancy term, captured by means of a feed-forward neural network. The re-casted format is highly adaptive and flexible to structural monitoring problems, such as linear …",Article,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022460X21002686
2020,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 144,Measurement of full-field displacement time history of a vibrating continuous edge from video,"Sutanu Bhowmick, Satish Nagarajaiah, Zhilu Lai",Sutanu Bhowmick,English,"Video of a vibrating structural component provides dense continuous spatial information of motion compared to contact based sensors which are more localized. In order to harness such quantitative information, various Computer Vision based methods have been studied in the past few years. Computer vision algorithms that implement sparse optical flow, tracks the displacement of few selected texture rich patches of pixels corresponding to salient points of the structure, in subsequent frames of the video starting from the initial frame. The obtained displacement response of individual, spatially discrete, points of the structure denotes the Lagrangian representation of motion. Such vision based measurement already proved its potential in replacing the need for a contact based vibration measuring sensors. However, full-field vibration response of a structural component, in its operating condition, is vital for identifying …",Article,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327020302338
2022,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 178,Physics-guided Deep Markov Models for learning nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty,"Wei Liu, Zhilu Lai, Kiran Bacsa, Eleni Chatzi",Wei Liu,English,"In this paper, we propose a probabilistic physics-guided framework, termed Physics-guided Deep Markov Model (PgDMM). The framework targets the inference of the characteristics and latent structure of nonlinear dynamical systems from measurement data, where exact inference of latent variables is typically intractable. A recently surfaced option pertains to leveraging variational inference to perform approximate inference. In such a scheme, transition and emission functions of the system are parameterized via feed-forward neural networks (deep generative models). However, due to the generalized and highly versatile formulation of neural network functions, the learned latent space often lacks physical interpretation and structured representation. To address this, we bridge physics-based state space models with Deep Markov Models, thus delivering a hybrid modeling framework for unsupervised learning and …",Article,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327022004204
2020,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 145,Full-field structural monitoring using event cameras and physics-informed sparse identification,"Zhilu Lai, Ignacio Alzugaray, Margarita Chli, Eleni Chatzi",Zhilu Lai,English,"This paper exploits a new direction of full-field structural monitoring and vibration analysis, using an emerging type of neuro-inspired vision sensors – namely event cameras. Compared to traditional frame-based cameras, event cameras offer salient benefits of resilience to motion blur, high dynamic range, and microsecond latency. Event cameras are herein exploited for structural monitoring, in order to extract dense measurements of structural response in terms of both spatial and temporal resolution. The output of an event camera is a stream of so called “events”, which is different to traditional snapshots. Due to this fundamentally different working principle, basic computer vision algorithms, such as optical flow or feature tracking, should be re-designed for processing event-based measurements. In this work, we present a novel framework termed physics-informed sparse identification, for full-field structural …",Article,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327020302910

This is particularly true for structural systems, which are typically high-dimensional in nature. In the scope of physics-informed machine learning, this article proposes a framework—termed neural modal ordinary differential equations (Neural Modal ODEs)—to integrate physics-based modeling with deep learning for modeling the dynamics of monitored and high-dimensional engineered systems. In this initiating exploration, we restrict ourselves to linear or mildly nonlinear systems. We propose an architecture that couples a dynamic version of variational autoencoders with physics-informed neural ODEs (Pi-Neural ODEs). An encoder, as a part of the autoencoder, learns the mappings from the first few items of observational data to the initial values of the …",Article,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-centric-engineering/article/neural-modal-ordinary-differential-equations-integrating-physicsbased-modeling-with-neural-ordinary-differential-equations-for-modeling-highdimensional-monitored-structures/FAF0447B372F8EDFE4DA13DC350ADAD9
2024,Structural Health Monitoring,Neural extended Kalman filters for learning and predicting dynamics of structural systems,"Wei Liu, Zhilu Lai, Kiran Bacsa, Eleni Chatzi",Wei Liu,English,"Accurate structural response prediction forms a main driver for structural health monitoring and control applications. This often requires the proposed model to adequately capture the underlying dynamics of complex structural systems. In this work, we utilize a learnable extended Kalman filter (EKF), named the neural extended Kalman filter (neural EKF) throughout this article, for learning the latent evolution dynamics of complex physical systems. The neural EKF is a generalized version of the conventional EKF, where the modeling of process dynamics and sensory observations can be parameterized by neural networks, therefore learned by end-to-end training. The method is implemented under the variational inference framework with the EKF conducting inference from sensing measurements. Typically, conventional variational inference models are parameterized by neural networks independent of the latent …",Article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14759217231179912

Standard variational autoencoders place greater emphasis on compression than interpretability regarding the learned latent space. We propose a new type of encoder, based on the recently developed Hamiltonian Neural Networks, to impose symplectic constraints on the inferred a posteriori distribution. In addition to delivering robust trajectory predictions under noisy conditions, our model is capable of learning an energy-preserving latent representation of the system.

In this paper, the spectrum of physics-enhanced machine learning methods, expressed across the defining axes of physics and data, is discussed by engaging in a comprehensive exploration of its characteristics, usage, and motivations. In doing so, this paper offers a survey of recent applications and developments of PEML techniques, revealing the potency of PEML in addressing complex challenges. We further demonstrate application of select such schemes on the simple working example of a single-degree-of-freedom Duffing oscillator, which allows to highlight the individual characteristics and motivations of different `genres' of PEML approaches. To promote collaboration and transparency, and to provide practical examples for the reader, the code of these working examples is provided alongside this paper.

2022,Structural Control and Health Monitoring,A robust bridge weigh‐in‐motion algorithm based on regularized total least squares with axle constraints,"Xudong Jian, Zhilu Lai, Ye Xia, Limin Sun",Xudong Jian,English," The identification of traffic loads, including the axle weight (AW) and the gross vehicle weight (GVW) of vehicles, plays an important role in bridge design refinement, safety evaluation, and maintenance strategies. Bridge weigh in motion (BWIM) is a promising technique to weigh vehicles passing through bridges. Though the state‐of‐the‐art BWIM can accurately identify the GVW, unacceptable weighing errors are reported when identifying the AW of vehicles, particularly for those with closely spaced axles. To address the axle weighing problem, this paper aims to improve the performance of BWIM in weighing individual axle loads apart from the gross vehicle weight. The work first theoretically analyzes the possible sources of errors of existing BWIM algorithms, which are observational errors residing in the BWIM equation, no constraint imposed on individual axle loads, and ill‐conditioned nature. Accordingly, three …",Article,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/stc.3014

The proposed approach employs programmable wheeled robots, whose movement can be remotely controlled, as the mobile platform carrying accelerometers. The output-only frequency domain decomposition (FDD) algorithm is adopted for use with the proposed stop-and-go mobile sensing scheme, resulting in the identification of frequencies and high-resolution mode shapes. The solution was verified via two numerical case studies and was validated on a full-scale test of a footbridge. The results reveal that the frequencies and high-resolution shapes of the excited structural modes are identified successfully using only two accelerometers, confirming the satisfactory practicality and efficiency of the proposed solution.",Article,https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/JSENDH.STENG-12635

In general, ISs of a real bridge can be identified through calibration tests using calibration vehicles with known weights moving across the bridge. However, the existing methods face difficulties in considering comprehensive factors, such as the lateral movement, speed variation, and track width of the calibration vehicle, as well as bridge dynamic effects. These factors inevitably introduce inaccuracies into the task of identification. To comprehensively consider these factors, this study proposes a deep learning-based method that combines deep multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and computer vision (CV), with deep MLP adopted to identify bridge ISs and CV employed to obtain the position coordinates of the calibration vehicle’s wheels.

2024,Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 218,Structural damage classification under varying environmental conditions and unknown classes via open set domain adaptation,"Mingyuan Zhou, Zhilu Lai",Mingyuan Zhou,English,"Deep learning has been increasingly employed in data-driven structural health monitoring (SHM), forming a new paradigm of assessing structural conditions and identifying structural damage. Many structural damage classification methods rely on the assumption that the data of training and test (application) phases are closely distributed, thereby allowing trained models to generalize to the test data effectively. However, these approaches often face challenges in real-world scenarios as test data are unlabeled and their distributions can differ due to environmental and operational variabilities (EOVs). Additionally, the test data might include unknown damage classes not present in the labeled data. Both EOVs and unknown damage classes can decrease the performance of current classification methods. To address these challenges, we propose a deep domain adaptation framework for structural damage …",Article,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088832702400459X
2024,arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.04822,M2NO: Multiresolution Operator Learning with Multiwavelet-based Algebraic Multigrid Method,"Zhihao Li, Zhilu Lai, Xiaobo Wang, Wei Wang",Zhihao Li,English,"Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) effectively necessitates a multi-scale approach, particularly critical in high-dimensional scenarios characterized by increasing grid points or resolution. Traditional methods often fail to capture the detailed features necessary for accurate modeling, presenting a significant challenge in scientific computing. In response, we introduce the Multiwavelet-based Algebraic Multigrid Neural Operator (M2NO), a novel deep learning framework that synergistically combines multiwavelet transformations and algebraic multigrid (AMG) techniques. By exploiting the inherent similarities between these two approaches, M2NO overcomes their individual limitations and enhances precision and flexibility across various PDE benchmarks. Employing Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) with high-pass and low-pass filters, the model executes hierarchical decomposition to accurately delineate both global trends and localized details within PDE solutions, supporting adaptive data representation at multiple scales. M2NO also automates node selection and adeptly manages complex boundary conditions through its multiwavelet-based operators. Extensive evaluations on a diverse array of PDE datasets with different boundary conditions confirm M2NO's superior performance. Furthermore, M2NO excels in handling high-resolution and super-resolution tasks, consistently outperforming competing models and demonstrating robust adaptability in complex computational scenarios.",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04822

When considering higher levels of the SHM hierarchy, purely data-driven methods are found to be lacking.

In framing robust predictors, capable of taking on complex dynamics, we propose a new variational autoencoder with physical priors, which is applied on estimation of the response of Multi ple Degree of Freedom (MDOF) systems. The standard variational autoencoders architecture emphasizes compression as opposed to interpretability of the learned latent features. In the case of dynamical systems, physical prior information can both augment the extrapolation property of neural networks and increase their interpretability. We propose a new type of encoder which imposes symplectic constraints on the inferred aposteriori distribution. We demonstrate, on illustrative examples of nonlinear systems, that the proposed scheme delivers robust trajectory predictions under partial and noisy observations of said systems.

2022,,Model-based Unknown Input Estimation via Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes,"Wei Liu, Zhilu Lai, Charikleia D Stoura, Kiran Bacsa, Eleni Chatzi",Wei Liu,English,"In the context of condition monitoring for structures and industrial assets, the estimation of unknown inputs, usually referring to acting loads, is of salient importance for guaranteeing safe and performant engineered systems. In this work, we propose a novel method for estimating unknown inputs from measured outputs, for the case of systems with a known or learned model of the underlying dynamics. The objective is to infer those system inputs that will reproduce the actual measured outputs; this can be reformulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem and solved with well-established planning algorithms for POMDPs. The cross-entropy method (CEM) is adopted in this paper for solving the POMDP due to its efficiency and robustness.
