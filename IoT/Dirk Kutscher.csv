2022,2022 international conference on smart applications,Architecture framework for intelligence orchestration in AIoT and IoT,"Edgar J Ramos, Marie-José Montpetit, Antonio F Skarmeta, Mathieu Boussard, Vangelis Angelakis, Dirk Kutscher",Edgar J Ramos,English,"The emergence of novel architectures such as fog and edge computing have blurred the boundaries between the network core and its periphery leading the Internet towards a computer board equivalent, while keeping the inherent distribution of the original Internet. In this paper, we present a novel architecture using an Intelligence Orchestration approach that is needed in this new network continuum computing paradigm. We aim to tackle the series of challenges of such as heterogeneity of stakeholders, use case and type of business dynamics, in addition to hardware and platforms by providing an “operating system” (OS) like design. The principles of the architecture are described and its advantages and needed next steps are also discussed.",Conference paper,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9994029/
2022,Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking,Delay-tolerant ICN and its application to LoRa,"Peter Kietzmann, José Alamos, Dirk Kutscher, Thomas C Schmidt, Matthias Wählisch",Peter Kietzmann,English,"Connecting long-range wireless networks to the Internet imposes challenges due to vastly longer round-trip-times (RTTs). In this paper, we present an ICN protocol framework that enables robust and efficient delay-tolerant communication to edge networks. Our approach provides ICN-idiomatic communication between networks with vastly different RTTs. We applied this framework to LoRa, enabling end-to-end consumer-to-LoRa-producer interaction over an ICN-Internet and asynchronous data production in the LoRa edge. Instead of using LoRaWAN, we implemented an IEEE 802.15.4e DSME MAC layer on top of the LoRa PHY and ICN protocol mechanisms in RIOT OS. Executed on off-the-shelf IoT hardware, we provide a comparative evaluation for basic NDN-style ICN [60], RICE [31]-like pulling, and reflexive forwarding [46]. This is the first practical evaluation of ICN over LoRa using a reliable MAC. Our …",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3517212.3558081

We have replaced the LoRaWAN MAC layer with an IEEE 802.15.4 Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension (DSME). This multifaceted MAC layer allows for different mappings of ICN message semantics, which we explore to enable new LoRa scenarios. We designed LoRa-ICN from the ground-up to improve reliability and to reduce dependency on centralized components in LoRa IoT scenarios. We have implemented a feature-complete prototype in a common network simulator to validate our approach. Our results show design trade-offs of different mapping alternatives in terms of robustness and efficiency.",Conference paper,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9829792/

ICN has been successfully applied to LoWPAN scenarios and can provide many benefits with respect to object-based security, performance, disruption tolerance and usability. Our findings indicate that the current LoRaWAN MAC layer is impractical for an ICN request-response with caching.

Several solutions have been developed to bootstrap IoT devices in localized environments, where the devices being bootstrapped are within the physical reach of their bootstrapper. However, distributed applications need to bootstrap remote users and devices into an NDN-based system over insecure Internet connectivity. In this work, we take Hydra, a federated distributed file storage system made of servers contributed by multiple participating organizations, as a use case to drive the design and development of a remote bootstrapping solution, dubbed Cornerstone. We describe the design of Cornerstone, evaluate its effectiveness, and discuss the lessons learned from this process. ",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3630590.3630598

2023,IEEE Communications Magazine,Rethinking LoRa for the IoT: An Information-centric Approach,"Peter Kietzmann, José Alamos, Dirk Kutscher, Thomas C Schmidt, Matthias Wählisch",Peter Kietzmann,English,"In this article, we present LoRa-ICN, a new long-range communication system that provides a versatile data-oriented integration of battery-driven LoRa nodes into the Internet of Things (IoT). LoRa-ICN builds on two paradigms: information-centric networking (ICN), which enables more direct, data-oriented communication between Internet systems and the low-power wireless domain, and 802.15.4 DSME, which is an IoT MAC layer that facilitates reliable LoRa transmissions. While the combination of LoRa and DSME is generally better suited for bi-directional end-to-end communication, it still incurs considerable long and variable transmission latencies, and challenges the network layer transition between the power-constrained wireless domain and the Internet.

2023,Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking …,Statement: The Metaverse as an Information-Centric Network,"Dirk Kutscher, Jeff Burke, Giuseppe Fioccola, Paulo Mendes",Dirk Kutscher,English,"This paper discusses challenges and opportunities of considering the Metaverse as an Information-Centric Network (ICN). The Web today essentially represents a data-centric application layer: data named by URLs is manipulated with REST primitives. However, the semantic gap with the underlying host-oriented transport is significant, typically leading to complexity, centralization, and brittleness. Popular interest in ""the Metaverse"" suggests that the end-user experience of the Web will evolve towards always-on eXtended Reality (XR). With the benefit of a historical perspective, computing advances, and decades of experience with a global network, there is an opportunity to holistically consider the Metaverse not as an application of the current network, but an evolution of the network itself, reducing rather than widening the gap between network architecture and application semantics. An ICN architecture offers the …",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3623565.3623761

Standardization processes require stamina as they may be lengthy, and they demand frustration resistance as they may hold surprises at all stages. While this certainly bears some similarity to academic endeavors, the need to build broader consensus and the potential of far reaching industry impact, among other factors, lead to different incentives and value systems. Peer review perspectives may also differ notably. In this paper, we discuss issues we came across in the past when trying to develop and advance technologies in the IETF or push presumed solid technology solutions towards standardization.

We revisit the original vision of the Web as a hypermedia system that supports document composability and application interoperability via name-based data access. We propose the use of secure web objects (SWO), a data-oriented communication approach that can reduce complexity, centrality, and inefficiency, particularly for collaborative and local-first applications, such as the Metaverse and other collaborative applications. SWO are named, signed, application-defined objects that are secured independently of their containers or communications channels, an approach that leverages the results from over a decade-long data-centric networking research. This approach does not require intermediation by aggregators of identity, storage, and other services that are common today. We present a brief design overview, illustrated through prototypes for two editors of shared hypermedia documents: one for 3D and one for LaTeX.
