2020,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"RepChain: A Reputation-based Secure, Fast, and High Incentive Blockchain System via Sharding","Chenyu Huang, Zeyu Wang, Huangxun Chen, Qiwei Hu, Qian Zhang, Wei Wang, Xia Guan",Chenyu Huang,English,"In today's blockchain system, designing a secure and high throughput blockchain on par with a centralized payment system is a difficult task. Sharding is one of the most worthwhile emerging technologies for improving the system throughput while maintain high-security level. However, previous sharding-related designs have two main limitations. First, the security and throughput of their random-based sharding system are not high enough as they did not leverage the heterogeneity among validators. Second, to design an incentive mechanism that promotes cooperation could incur a huge overhead on their system. In this article, we propose RepChain, a reputation-based secure and fast blockchain system via sharding, which also provides high incentive to stimulate node cooperation. RepChain utilizes reputation to explicitly characterize the heterogeneity among the validators and lay the foundation for the incentive …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9211723/,171,huang2020repchain
2020,IEEE Network,Joint Design of Sensing and Communication Systems for Smart Homes,"Qianyi Huang, Huangxun Chen, Qian Zhang",Qianyi Huang,English,"With the recent advance of technologies, smart homes are no longer just the subjects of science fiction and are now becoming a reality. it is essential for a smart home to understand its residents and provide entertainment and healthcare services. Researchers have demonstrated the great potential of RF sensing in smart homes, including understanding the residents' gesture commands and monitoring the residents' health status unobtrusively. Although RF sensing has appealing properties, it brings congestion to wireless networks. To make the situation worse, there is an unprecedented amount of wireless traffic in smart homes. in this article, we investigate the joint design of sensing and communication systems to alleviate the strain on wireless resources. instead of designing sensing and communication systems as separate objectives, we tend to address them jointly. We discuss this issue from two directions. The …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9143269/,33,huang2020joint
2020,Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence,ECGadv: Generating Adversarial Electrocardiogram to Misguide Arrhythmia Classification System,"Huangxun Chen, Chenyu Huang, Qianyi Huang, Qian Zhang, Wei Wang",Huangxun Chen,English,"Deep neural networks (DNNs)-powered Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis systems recently achieve promising progress to take over tedious examinations by cardiologists. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks still lack comprehensive investigation. The existing attacks in image domain could not be directly applicable due to the distinct properties of ECGs in visualization and dynamic properties. Thus, this paper takes a step to thoroughly explore adversarial attacks on the DNN-powered ECG diagnosis system. We analyze the properties of ECGs to design effective attacks schemes under two attacks models respectively. Our results demonstrate the blind spots of DNN-powered diagnosis systems under adversarial attacks, which calls attention to adequate countermeasures.",Article,https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5748,26,chen2020ecgadv

In this work, we present an assistant framework NAssim, to help NetOps accelerate the process of assimilating a new device into a SDN network. Our solution features a unified parser framework to parse diverse device user manuals into preliminary configuration models, a rigorous validator that confirm the correctness of the models via formal syntax analysis, model hierarchy validation and empirical data validation, and a deep-learning-based mapping algorithm that uses state-of-the-art neural language processing techniques to produce human-comprehensible recommended mapping between the validated configuration model and the one in the SDN …",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544216.3544244,16,chen2022software
2021,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,ZkRep: A Privacy-Preserving Scheme for Reputation-based Blockchain System,"Chenyu Huang, Yongjun Zhao, Huangxun Chen, Xu Wang, Qian Zhang, Yanjiao Chen, Huaxiong Wang, Kwok-Yan Lam",Chenyu Huang,English,"Reputation/trust-based blockchain systems have attracted considerable research interests for better integrating Internet of Things with blockchain in terms of throughput, scalability, energy efficiency, and incentive aspects. However, most existing works only consider static adversaries. Hence, they are vulnerable to slowly adaptive attackers, who can target validators with high reputation value to severely degrade the system performance. Therefore, we introduce    , a privacy-preserving scheme tailored for reputation-based blockchains. Our basic idea is to hide both the identity and reputation of the validators by periodically changing the identity and reputation commitments (i.e., aliases), which makes it much more difficult for slowly adaptive attackers to identify validators with high reputation value. To realize this idea, we utilize privacy-preserving Pedersen-commitment-based reputation updating and leader election …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9521236/,14,huang2021zkrep
2022,Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive,WiAdv: Practical and Robust Adversarial Attack against Wifi-based Gesture Recognition System,"Yuxuan Zhou, Huangxun Chen, Chenyu Huang, Qian Zhang",Yuxuan Zhou,English,"WiFi-based gesture recognition systems have attracted enormous interest owing to the non-intrusive of WiFi signals and the wide adoption of WiFi for communication. Despite boosted performance via integrating advanced deep neural network (DNN) classifiers, there lacks sufficient investigation on their security vulnerabilities, which are rooted in the open nature of the wireless medium and the inherent defects (e.g., adversarial attacks) of classifiers. To fill this gap, we aim to study adversarial attacks to DNN-powered WiFi-based gesture recognition to encourage proper countermeasures. We design WiAdv to construct physically realizable adversarial examples to fool these systems. WiAdv features a signal synthesis scheme to craft adversarial signals with desired motion features based on the fundamental principle of WiFi-based gesture recognition, and a black-box attack scheme to handle the inconsistency …",Article,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3534618,11,zhou2022wiadv
2022,Proceedings of the 31st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2022),CamShield: Securing Smart Cameras through Physical Replication and Isolation,"Zhiwei Wang, Yihui Yan, Yueli Yan, Huangxun Chen, Zhice Yang",Zhiwei Wang,English,"Smart home devices, such as security cameras, are equipped with visual sensors, either for monitoring or improving user experience. Due to the sensitivity of the home environment, their visual sensing capabilities cause privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we design and implement the CamShield, a companion device to guarantee the privacy of smart security cameras, even if the whole camera system is fully compromised. At a high level, the CamShield is a shielding case that works by attaching it to the front of the security camera to blind it. Then, it uses its own camera for visual recording. The videos are first protected according to user-specified policies, and then transmitted to the security camera and hence to the Internet through a Visible Light Communication (VLC) channel. It ensures that only the authorized entities have full access to the protected videos. Since the CamShield is physically isolated from the shielded security camera and the Internet, it naturally resists many known attacks and can operate as it is expected to.",Conference paper,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/wang-zhiwei,8,wang2022camshield
2021,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,SecurePilot: Improving Wireless Security of Single-Antenna IoT Devices,"Huangxun Chen, Qianyi Huang, Chenyu Huang, Chenchen Liu, Tony Xiao Han, Qian Zhang",Huangxun Chen,English,"With the arrival of the Internet of Things era, IoT devices and the services built on them make our lives more convenient and also raise public concerns on their vulnerability to attacks. Recent literature advocates physical-layer solutions to help IoT devices detect attacks instead of using sophisticated cryptographic methods. However, there is still no satisfying solutions for IoT devices with a single antenna and sparse traffic. Thus, we introduce SecurePilot to fill this gap. SecurePilot is an unsupervised and plug-and-play solution which works without an attacker’s knowledge in advance. It leverages the strengths of two orthogonal physical-layer information, propagation signatures and device signatures embedded in pilot signals to enable effective attack detection. It could work on single-antenna IoT devices with sparse traffic and also work compatibly with communication protocols.

2023,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,EHTrack: Earphone-based Head Tracking via Only Acoustic Signals,"Linfei Ge, Qian Zhang, Jin Zhang, Huangxun Chen",Linfei Ge,English,"Head tracking is a technique that allows for the measurement and analysis of human focus and attention, thus enhancing the experience of human–computer interaction (HCI). Nevertheless, current solutions relying on vision and motion sensors exhibit limitations in accuracy, user-friendliness, and compatibility with the majority of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. To overcome these limitations, we present EHTrack, an earphone-based system that achieves head tracking exclusively through acoustic signals. EHTrack employs acoustic sensing to measure the movement of a pair of earphones, subsequently enabling precise head tracking. In particular, a pair of speakers generates a periodically fluctuating sound field, which the user’s two earphones detect. By assessing the distance and angle alterations between the earphones and speakers, we propose a model to determine the user’s head movement and …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10192901/,4,ge2023ehtrack
2023,IEEE INFOCOM 2023-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,CSI-StripeFormer: Exploiting Stripe Features for CSI Compression in Massive MIMO System,"Qingyong Hu, Hua Kang, Huangxun Chen, Qianyi Huang, Qian Zhang, Min Cheng",Qingyong Hu,English,"The massive MIMO gain for wireless communication has been greatly hindered by the feedback overhead of channel state information (CSI) growing linearly with the number of antennas. Recent efforts leverage the DNN-based encoder-decoder framework to exploit correlations within the CSI matrix for better CSI compression. However, existing works have not fully exploited the unique features of CSI, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance under high compression ratios and sensitivity to multipath effects. Instead of treating CSI as common 2D matrices like images, we reveal the intrinsic stripe-based correlation across the CSI matrix. Driven by this insight, we propose CSI-StripeFormer, a stripe-aware encoder-decoder framework to exploit the unique stripe feature for better CSI compression. We design a lightweight encoder with asymmetric convolution kernels to capture various shape features.

2023,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,Cross-Graph Embedding with Trainable Proximity for Graph Alignment,"Wei Tang, Haifeng Sun, Jingyu Wang, Qi Qi, Huangxun Chen, Li Chen",Wei Tang,English,"Graph alignment, also known as network alignment, has many applications in data mining tasks. It aims to find the node correspondence across disjoint graphs. With recent representation learning advancements, embedding-based graph alignment has become a hot topic. Existing embedding-based methods focus either on structural proximity across graphs or on the positional proximity within a single graph. However, only considering the structural similarity will make the position relation of nodes not clear enough, which makes it easy to misalign the nodes close in distance, while only considering the position proximity of a single graph will make the node embeddings from different graphs in different subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel model CEGA for  C ross-graph  E mbedding-based  G raph  A lignment, which can generate node embeddings to reflect structural proximity and positional …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10107802/,3,tang2023cross

Active acoustic sensing can enable convenient gesture interaction on smart speakers to complement voice interaction in mandatory quiet scenarios and address privacy concerns. However, existing solutions did not consider the impact of the widely adopted uniform circular geometry of commercial smart speakers on gesture tracking. To fill this gap, we propose SparseTrack to achieve fine-grained multi-user device-free gesture tracking on commercial smart speakers. We cast gesture tracking to sparse recovery intuition to address signal coherence issue on uniform circular mic-array. We then synthesize wideband measurement to eliminate spatial ambiguity caused by the insufficient spatial sampling rate of today’s smart speakers in the ultrasonic frequency band.

2024,Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive,RimSense: Enabling Touch-based Interaction on Eyeglass Rim Using Piezoelectric Sensors,"Wentao Xie, Huangxun Chen, Jing Wei, Jin Zhang, Qian Zhang",Wentao Xie,English,"Smart eyewear's interaction mode has attracted significant research attention. While most commercial devices have adopted touch panels situated on the temple front of eyeglasses for interaction, this paper identifies a drawback stemming from the unparalleled plane between the touch panel and the display, which disrupts the direct mapping between gestures and the manipulated objects on display. Therefore, this paper proposes RimSense, a proof-of-concept design for smart eyewear, to introduce an alternative realm for interaction - touch gestures on eyewear rim. RimSense leverages piezoelectric (PZT) transducers to convert the eyeglass rim into a touch-sensitive surface. When users touch the rim, the alteration in the eyeglass's structural signal manifests its effect into a channel frequency response (CFR). This allows RimSense to recognize the executed touch gestures based on the collected CFR patterns …",Article,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631456,0,xie2024rimsense

To bridge this gap, we present RIStealth, a practical and covert attack that leverages RIS technology to render a moving individual undetectable by WiFi-based intrusion detection systems in real-life scenarios.
