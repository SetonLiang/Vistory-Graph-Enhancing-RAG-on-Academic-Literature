2020,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,Estimating doubly-selective channels for hybrid mmWave massive MIMO systems: A doubly-sparse approach,"Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang",Shijian Gao,English,"In mmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems, hybrid (digital/analog) structure has been a prevalent option to balance system cost and performance. To facilitate transceiver design in hybrid mmWave mMIMO, acquiring an accurate channel state information is critical. To this end, a novel doubly-sparse approach is proposed to estimate doubly-selective mmWave channels under hybrid mMIMO. Via the judiciously designed training pattern, the well-utilized beamspace sparsity alongside the under-investigated delay-domain sparsity that mmWave channels exhibit can be jointly exploited to assist channel estimation. Thanks to our careful two-stage (random-probing and steering-probing) design, the proposed channel estimator possesses strong robustness against the double (frequency and time) selectivity whilst enjoying the benefits brought by the exploitation of double sparsity.

2021,IEEE Transactions on Communications,Mutual information maximizing wideband multi-user (wMU) mmWave massive MIMO,"Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang",Shijian Gao,English,"To enable next-generation mmWave cellular, it is vital to design high-performance precoding schemes for wideband multi-user (wMU) mmWave massive MIMO (mMIMO). As existing approaches are mostly ad-hoc, thereby lacking performance guarantee, we will tailor an enhanced transceiver design explicitly for wMU mmWave mMIMO, with the goal of maximizing mutual information (MI). The proposed scheme follows the prevalent hybrid block diagonalization (HBD-)based framework that is well-known for balancing the transmitter-end processing flexibility and the user-end detection complexity. In this paper, we for the first time prove that HBD is optimal in the sense of MI. In terms of the transceiver design, we start by decoupling the hybrid processing into a two-stage analog and digital processing, and then derive the MI bounds associated with HBD. By optimizing the tight MI bound, excellent HBD transceivers are …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9335256/

2022,Medical Image Analysis 82,Anticipation for surgical workflow through instrument interaction and recognized Signals,"Kun Yuan, Matthew Holden, Shijian Gao, Wonsook Lee",Kun Yuan,English,"Surgical workflow anticipation is an essential task for computer-assisted intervention (CAI) systems. It aims at predicting the future surgical phase and instrument occurrence, providing support for intra-operative decision-support system. Recent studies have promoted the development of the anticipation task by transforming it into a remaining time prediction problem, but without factoring the surgical instruments’ behaviors and their interactions with surrounding anatomies in the network design. In this paper, we propose an Instrument Interaction Aware Anticipation Network (IIA-Net) to overcome the previous deficiency while retaining the merits of two-stage models through using spatial feature extractor and temporal model. Spatially, feature extractor utilizes tooltips’ movement to extracts the instrument–instrument interaction, which helps model concentrate on the surgeon’s actions.

As ISAC does not automatically guarantee excellence, we therefore carefully formulate two types of problems to jointly optimize power allocation and link selection. Via the proposed efficient solvers, either the power consumption or the outage probability can be significantly lowered than the traditional non-sensing-aided V2V. Aside from the sensed positioning information, the sensed velocity information is also exploited in V2V networking to help combat the Doppler shifts. Thanks to our optimum-ensuring scheme and merit-distilling analysis, this preliminary study is promising to provide a valuable guideline for the deployment of ISAC in future vehicular networks.",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9963569/

Unlike most existing fully-digital IM techniques whose application to wideband channels is straightforward after adopting the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique, extending GBM from the narrowband to wideband channels is quite challenging. The reason is that the per-subcarrier process in hybrid OFDM systems is no longer independent across individuals as all subcarriers share a common analog beamformer. Hence, the designed wideband GBM (wGBM) has to be compatible with hybrid OFDM systems while maintaining the SE-enhanced merit of GBM.

However, the inherent non-linear distortion renders the detectors designed for classical transparent communications inapplicable, leading to an urgent need for novel detecting solutions dedicated to 1-bit systems. Although a few endeavours have been made towards learning-based (as opposed to the traditional model-based) detectors for multi-user (MU) 1-bit systems, they are exclusively limited to narrowband channels and fail to cope with the multi-path effects inevitable to mmWave systems. In this paper, we first design a learning-based detector (LeaD) for general wideband multi-user (wMU) scenarios.

To fully inherit its advantages and overcome its unfeasibility to mmWave hybrid massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO) systems, a novel hybrid PSM (hPSM) is carefully proposed. Except for a similar digital design, hPSM distinctly differs from PSM for its dependence on the analog part of the mmWave mMIMO transceivers. Moreover, unlike PSM where the relevant design suffices to be restricted on a single subcarrier, hPSM requires joint consideration across all subcarriers. Thanks to our judicious design, the error performance of hPSM is optimized and demonstrated to be advantageous over its non-hPSM counterpart. Meanwhile, the overall design is compatible with prevalent hybrid mmWave systems and enjoys a low implementation complexity.",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8989776/
2023,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,Scalable bayesian meta-learning through generalized implicit gradients,"Yilang Zhang, Bingcong Li, Shijian Gao, Georgios B Giannakis",Yilang Zhang,English,"Meta-learning owns unique effectiveness and swiftness in tackling emerging tasks with limited data. Its broad applicability is revealed by viewing it as a bi-level optimization problem. The resultant algorithmic viewpoint however, faces scalability issues when the inner-level optimization relies on gradient-based iterations. Implicit differentiation has been considered to alleviate this challenge, but it is restricted to an isotropic Gaussian prior, and only favors deterministic meta-learning approaches. This work markedly mitigates the scalability bottleneck by cross-fertilizing the benefits of implicit differentiation to probabilistic Bayesian meta-learning. The novel implicit Bayesian meta-learning (iBaML) method not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also quantifies the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, the ultimate complexity is well controlled regardless of the inner-level optimization trajectory. Analytical error bounds are established to demonstrate the precision and efficiency of the generalized implicit gradient over the explicit one. Extensive numerical tests are also carried out to empirically validate the performance of the proposed method.",Article,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26337

First, we generalize the existing beam index modulation (BIM) from the hybrid narrowband to hybrid wideband systems and from activating single beam to activating multiple beams. Secondly, an effective first-order Doppler pre-compensator is introduced to assist index modulation, such that the originally complicated block-based maximum likelihood (ML) detection degenerates into the simple subcarrier-based ML detection.

Leaping from its wideband form, namely, wideband GBM (WGBM), a further enhanced version termed precoded WGBM (P-WGBM) will be studied, striving for performance improvement by actively involving the digital precoder. Unfortunately, the seemingly “straightforward” extension proves to be challenging because of the precoding constraint and computation complexity. To overcome these obstacles, this letter has carefully formulated an optimization problem, aiming to find an optimal precoder that retains GBM’s multiplexing merit.

However, the widespread adoption of hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to limited radio-frequency chains, resulting in mediocre performance when embedding sensing functionality. To avoid sacrificing the spectrum efficiency in hybrid structures while addressing performance bottlenecks in its extension to ISAC, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC). BPM-ISAC applies index modulation over beamspace by selectively activating communication beams, aiming to minimize sensing beampattern mean squared error (MSE) under communication MSE constraints through dedicated hybrid transceiver design. Optimization involves the analog part through a min-MSE-based beam selection algorithm, followed by the digital part using an alternating optimization algorithm.

However, this method completely changes the existing feedback strategies, making it impractical to deploy in recent years. To address this issue, this paper proposes a channel modeling aided data augmentation method based on a limited number of field channel data. Specifically, the user equipment (UE) extracts the primary stochastic parameters of the field channel data and transmits them to the base station (BS). The BS then updates the typical TR 38.901 model parameters with the extracted parameters. In this way, the updated channel model is used to generate the dataset.

However, existing channel prediction methods lack precision due to model mismatch errors or network generalization issues. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful modeling and generalization abilities, and have been successfully applied to cross-modal tasks, including the time series analysis. Leveraging the expressive power of LLMs, we propose a pre-trained LLM-empowered channel prediction method (LLM4CP) to predict the future downlink channel state information (CSI) sequence based on the historical uplink CSI sequence. We fine-tune the network while freezing most of the parameters of the pre-trained LLM for better cross-modality knowledge transfer. To bridge the gap between the channel data and the feature space of the LLM, preprocessor, embedding, and output modules are specifically tailored by taking into account unique channel characteristics.

However, the communication channel in this scenario exhibits time-varying characteristics, and the potential targets may move rapidly, creating a doubly-dynamic phenomenon. This nature poses a challenge for real-time precoder design. While optimization-based solutions are widely researched, they are complex and heavily rely on perfect prior information, which is impractical in double dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose using constrained deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) to facilitate dynamic updates to the ISAC precoder design. Additionally, the primal dual-deep deterministic policy gradient (PD-DDPG) and Wolpertinger architecture are tailored to efficiently train the algorithm under complex constraints and variable numbers of users.

In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts.

Furthermore, the sensitivity to Doppler shift hinders its broader applications in dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a superposed index-modulated OFDM (S-IM-OFDM). The proposed scheme improves the sensing performance without excess power consumption by translating the energy efficiency of IM-OFDM onto sensing-oriented signals over OFDM.
