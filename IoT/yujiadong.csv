2020,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Resource allocation with edge computing in IoT networks via machine learning,"Xiaolan Liu, Jiadong Yu, Jian Wang, Yue Gao",Xiaolan Liu,English,"In this article, we investigate resource allocation with edge computing in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks via machine learning approaches. Edge computing is playing a promising role in IoT networks by providing computing capabilities close to users. However, the massive number of users in IoT networks requires sufficient spectrum resource to transmit their computation tasks to an edge server, while the IoT users were developed to have more powerful computation ability recently, which makes it possible for them to execute some tasks locally. Then, the design of computation task offloading policies for such IoT edge computing systems remains challenging. In this article, centralized user clustering is explored to group the IoT users into different clusters according to users’ priorities. The cluster with the highest priority is assigned to offload computation tasks and executed at the edge server, while the lowest priority cluster …",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8972358/
2020,China Communications,Multi-agent reinforcement learning for resource allocation in IoT networks with edge computing,"Xiaolan Liu, Jiadong Yu, Zhiyong Feng, Yue Gao",Xiaolan Liu,English,"To support popular Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as virtual reality and mobile games, edge computing provides a front-end distributed computing archetype of centralized cloud computing with low latency and distributed data processing. However, it is challenging for multiple users to offload their computation tasks because they are competing for spectrum and computation as well as Radio Access Technologies (RAT) resources. In this paper, we investigate computation offloading mechanism of multiple selfish users with resource allocation in IoT edge computing networks by formulating it as a stochastic game. Each user is a learning agent observing its local network environment to learn optimal decisions on either local computing or edge computing with a goal of minimizing long term system cost by choosing its transmit power level, RAT and sub-channel without knowing any information of the other …",,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9205989/
2020,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,3D channel tracking for UAV-satellite communications in space-air-ground integrated networks,"Jiadong Yu, Xiaolan Liu, Yue Gao, Xuemin Shen",Jiadong Yu,English,"The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) aims to provide seamless wide-area connections, high throughput and strong resilience for 5G and beyond communications. Acting as a crucial link segment of the SAGIN, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-satellite communication has drawn much attention. However, it is a key challenge to track dynamic channel information due to the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite orbiting and three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectory. In this paper, we explore the 3D channel tracking for a Ka-band UAV-satellite communication system. We firstly propose a statistical dynamic channel model called 3D two-dimensional Markov model (3D-2D-MM) for the UAV-satellite communication system by exploiting the probabilistic insight relationship of both hidden value vector and joint hidden support vector.

It has strict visual and physical requirements to ensure an immersive experience (i.e., high visual quality, low motion-to-photon latency, and real-time tactile and control experience). However, the current technologies fall short to satisfy these requirements. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been indispensable to enable low latency and powerful computing. Moreover, the sixth generation (6G) networks promise to provide end users with seamless communications. In this paper, we explore and demonstrate the synergistic relationship between 6G and mobile-edge technologies in empowering the Metaverse with ubiquitous communications and computation. This includes the usage of heterogeneous radios, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and digital twins (DTs) - assisted MEC.

2020,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Long-term channel statistic estimation for highly-mobile hybrid mmWave multi-user MIMO systems,"Jiadong Yu, Xiaolan Liu, Haoran Qi, Yue Gao",Jiadong Yu,English,"Channel estimation is crucial to beamforming techniques in directional millimetre wave (mmWave) communications, which is generally designed based on channel state information static. However, due to the Doppler effect caused by the mobility of users, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed trains and autonomous vehicles, the mmWave channel is changing rapidly. Spatial channel covariance, defined by long-term statistic information of channels, is a promising solution to reduce channel estimation frequency and can be used to design hybrid precoders. In this paper, we first proposed a highly mobile hybrid mmWave multi-user (MU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system based on transition probabilities which can represent moving action of the MU.

In contrast to online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which can incur substantial communication overheads and longer delays, the majority of existing works employ offline-trained RL algorithms for resource allocation decisions in MEC systems. However, they neglect the impact of desynchronization between the physical and digital worlds on the effectiveness of the allocation strategy. In this paper, we tackle this desynchronization using a continual RL (CRL) framework that facilitates the resource allocation dynamically for MEC-enabled VR content streaming.

We first introduce a quality of experience (QoE) metric to measure user experience, which considers the MEC system's latency, user attention levels, and preferred resolutions. Then, a QoE maximization problem is formulated for resource allocation to ensure the highest possible user experience,which is cast as a reinforcement learning problem, aiming to learn a generalized policy applicable across diverse user environments for all MEC servers. To learn the generalized policy, we propose a framework that employs federated learning (FL) and prompt-based sequence modeling to pre-train a common decision model across MEC servers, which is named FedPromptDT. Using FL solves the problem of insufficient local MEC data while protecting user privacy during offline training.
