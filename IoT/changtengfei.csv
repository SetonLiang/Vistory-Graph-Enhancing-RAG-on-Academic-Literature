2020,Internet Technology Letters,6TiSCH minimal scheduling function: Performance evaluation,"Tengfei Chang, Mališa Vučinić, Xavier V Guillén, Diego Dujovne, Thomas Watteyne",Tengfei Chang,English,"6TiSCH is a standardization group within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that works on IPv6‐enabled Time‐slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) networks. The 6TiSCH protocol stack, designed by the standardization work at the IETF, has direct applicability to low‐power Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, including smart factory, building, infrastructure and home applications. A key component of the 6TiSCH stack is the Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF). MSF implements a traffic adaptation algorithm which allocates link‐layer resources, that is, cells in the TSCH schedule, according to the traffic load. MAX_NUMCELL is an important parameter defined in the MSF draft standard which determines the length of the running window used to measure cell usage. MSF draft standard does not recommend a value of MAX_NUMCELL to use. This paper provides recommendations on how to choose the value of …",Article,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/itl2.170,22,chang20206tisch
2020,IEEE Access 8,Key performance indicators of the reference 6TiSCH implementation in Internet-of-Things scenarios,"Mališa Vučinić, Tengfei Chang, Božidar Škrbić, Enis Kočan, Milica Pejanović-Djurišić, Thomas Watteyne",Mališa Vučinić,English,"Tens of thousands of wireless industrial monitoring deployments exist today, logging more than 18 billion operating hours. These solutions have been around for over a decade and are based on standards such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a to provide performance guarantees to the applications. The new trend in industry deployments is the convergence of operational and information technologies happening through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm. The challenge is to bridge the performance of these well-proven industrial standards with the interoperability of IP-based systems. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the organization behind most of the technical solutions of the Internet, has produced a set of specifications with this requirement in mind. The output of this effort is the 6TiSCH protocol stack based on open standards, such as those that have played a key role in the Internet's …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9078083/,22,vuvcinic2020key
2020,Sensors,6TiSCH on SCμM: running a synchronized protocol stack without crystals,"Tengfei Chang, Thomas Watteyne, Brad Wheeler, Filip Maksimovic, Osama Khan, Sahar Mesri, Lydia Lee, Ioana Suciu, David Burnett, Xavier Vilajosana, Kris Pister",Tengfei Chang,English,"We report the first time-synchronized protocol stack running on a crystal-free device. We use an early prototype of the Single-Chip micro Mote, SCμM, a single-chip 2 × 3 mm2 mote-on-a-chip, which features an ARM Cortex-M0 micro-controller and an IEEE802.15.4 radio. This prototype consists of an FPGA version of the micro-controller, connected to the SCμM chip which implements the radio front-end. We port OpenWSN, a reference implementation of a synchronized protocol stack, onto SCμM. The challenge is that SCμM has only on-chip oscillators, with no absolute time reference such as a crystal. We use two calibration steps – receiving packets via the on-chip optical receiver and RF transceiver – to initially calibrate the oscillators on SCμM so that it can send frames to an off-the-shelf IEEE802.15.4 radio. We then use a digital trimming compensation algorithm based on tick skipping to turn a 567 ppm apparent drift into a 10 ppm drift. This allows us to run a full-featured standards-compliant 6TiSCH network between one SCμM and one OpenMote. This is a step towards realizing the smart dust vision of ultra-small and cheap ubiquitous wireless devices.",Article,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/7/1912,20,chang20206tisch
2020,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Quickcal: Assisted calibration for crystal-free micromotes,"Tengfei Chang, Thomas Watteyne, Filip Maksimovic, Brad Wheeler, David C Burnett, Titan Yuan, Xavier Vilajosana, Kristofer SJ Pister",Tengfei Chang,English,"The single-chip micro mote (SC   ) is a crystal-free single-chip mote that brings us one step closer to the Smart Dust vision, in particular, as it can communicate with off-the-shelf IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth low energy devices. However, before it can be part of such networks, the crystal-free SC    chip needs to be able to accurately tune its communication frequency to synchronize to the network. This is a challenge since its onboard RC and LC-based resonating circuits have a drift rate that can be three orders of magnitude worse than crystal-based oscillators typically used in today’s radios. This article introduces QuickCal, a solution that allows an SC    chip to self-calibrate against off-the-shelf devices dedicated to assisting with its calibration. We show that an SC    chip can self-calibrate against this QuickCal Box in fewer than 3 min. We further validate that once it has self-calibrated, an SC    chip can …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9164897/,9,chang2020quickcal

2022,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Surviving the Hair Dryer: Continuous Calibration of a Crystal-Free Mote-on-Chip,"Tengfei Chang, Thomas Watteyne, Brad Wheeler, Filip Maksimovic, David C Burnett, Kris Pister",Tengfei Chang,English,"The single-chip micro-mote (SC   ) is a     mm 2  single-chip crystal-free mote-on-chip. SC    implements the IEEE802.15.4 and BLE standards and can communicate with off-the-shelf radios compliant to those standards. SC    exclusively uses on-chip oscillators, including a 2.4-GHz LC oscillator to synthesize the communication frequency, and a 2-MHz RC oscillator to clock the chip rate. The challenge is that the LC oscillator drifts at 2100 ppm over a temperature range of 45 °C, far from the 40-ppm maximum drift mandated by the IEEE802.15.4 standard. While one-shot calibration is possible, any temperature change causes IEEE802.15.4 communication to fail. This article describes a continuous calibration approach for SC    to adapt the tuning of its oscillators as the temperature changes. Experimental results show that it allows SC    to keep communicating with an IEEE802.15.4 radio even …",Article,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9523577/,4,chang2021surviving
2021,,RFC 9033 6TiSCH Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF),"Tengfei Chang, Mališa Vučinić, Xavier Vilajosana, Simon Duquennoy, Diego Dujovne",Tengfei Chang,English,"This document describes the minimal framework required for a new device, called"" pledge"", to securely join a 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15. 4e) network. The framework requires that the pledge and the JRC (join registrar/coordinator, a central entity), share a symmetric key. How this key is provisioned is out of scope of this document. Through a single CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) request-response exchange secured by OSCORE (Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments), the pledge requests admission into the network and the JRC configures it with link-layer keying material and other parameters. The JRC may at any time update the parameters through another request-response exchange secured by OSCORE. This specification defines the Constrained Join Protocol and its CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data structures, and describes how to configure the rest of the 6TiSCH communication stack for this join process to occur in a secure manner. Additional security mechanisms may be added on top of this minimal framework.",Conference paper,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10088176148856975227&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1,chang2021rfc9033

The device foregoes the use of a crystal by leveraging its internal oscillators to enable 2.4 GHz communication. Due to variations in manufacturing and changes in the environment, SCµM's on-chip oscillators require calibration. Inter-Cal, a calibration method for SCµM, accurately determines the necessary frequencies for both transmission (TX) and reception (RX). Unlike other methods, Inter-Cal can calibrate all of SCµM's internal oscillators, including the 2 MHz RC and LC oscillators in both TX and RX modes, by simply listening for a valid packet. Inter-Cal is a scalable solution characterized by its minimal overhead and low latency.

SCµM features a 2.4 GHz wireless transceiver, which relies on its internal oscillator circuit, without an external crystal. The chip is embedded with an optical receiver, and supports optical programming functionality. Meanwhile, the optical receiver can detect infrared light, enabling low-power localization of the SCµM with the assistance of a lighthouse positioning base station. For the communication, the inaccurate internal oscillator of SCµM requires calibration before communicating with other commercial off-the-shelf wireless products, such as a Bluetooth device.
