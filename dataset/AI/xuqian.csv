In GRAND, we first design a random propagation strategy to perform graph data augmentation. Then we leverage consistency regularization to optimize the prediction consistency of unlabeled nodes across different data augmentations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmark datasets suggest that GRAND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN baselines on semi-supervised node classification. Finally, we show that GRAND mitigates the issues of over-smoothing and non-robustness, exhibiting better generalization behavior than existing GNNs.

The generative learning task can be formulated as interpolating between a reference distribution and a target distribution based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. At the population level, this entropy interpolation is characterized via an SDE on [0, 1] with a time-varying drift term. At the sample level, we derive our Schr {?} dinger Bridge algorithm by plugging the drift term estimated by a deep score estimator and a deep density ratio estimator into the Euler-Maruyama method. Under some mild smoothness assumptions of the target distribution, we prove the consistency of both the score estimator and the density ratio estimator, and then establish the consistency of the proposed Schr {?} dinger Bridge approach. Our theoretical results guarantee that the distribution learned by our approach converges to the target distribution. Experimental results on multimodal synthetic data and benchmark data support our theoretical findings and indicate that the generative model via Schr {?} dinger Bridge is comparable with state-of-the-art GANs, suggesting a new formulation of generative learning. We demonstrate its usefulness in image interpolation and image inpainting.",Conference paper,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/wang21l.html,82,wang2021deep,"entropy interpolation,deep generative learning"

Existing deployed FL frameworks cannot address the key issues of varying data quality and heterogeneous data distributions across multiple institutions in this sector. In this paper, we report our experience developing and deploying the Contribution-Aware Federated Learning (CAFL) framework for smart healthcare. It provides an efficient and accurate approach to fairly evaluate FL participants' contribution to model performance without exposing their private data, and improves the FL model training protocol to allow the best performing intermediate models to be distributed to participants for FL training. Since its deployment in Yidu Cloud Technology Inc. in March 2021, CAFL has served 8 well-established medical institutions in China to build healthcare decision support models. It can perform contribution evaluations 2.84 times faster than the best existing approach, and has improved the average accuracy of the resulting models by 2.62% compared to the previous system (which is significant in industrial settings).

However, recent research shows two persisting problems in FL that have yet to be solved: (1) limited practical adaptation of federated learning because of time-consuming conventional privacy-preserving methods, and (2) the absence of quantum-computing resistance in these methods. To address these problems, we propose a novel vertical federated learning strategy, HQsFL, which relies on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Matrix Vector Product basing on Coefficient Encoding. The proposed method can be widely applied to FL algorithms such as logistic regression and XGBoost, etc. We fully implement our approach and evaluate its utility and efficiency through extensive experiments?¡­",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3634737.3656285,0,yu2024hqsfl,"federated learning, fully homomorphic encryption, matrix vector multiplication, quantum-safe cryptography"

However, the data of one single organization may not be enough to build an accurate recommendation model for inactive or new cold-start users. Moreover, due to the recent regulatory restrictions on user privacy and data security, as well as the commercial conflicts, the raw data in different organizations cannot be merged to alleviate the scarcity issue in training a model. In order to learn users¡¯ preferences from such cross-silo data of different organizations and then provide recommendations to the cold-start users, we propose a novel federated learning framework, i.e., federated cross-organization recommendation ecosystem (FedCORE).

Due to the highly sensitive nature of patient data, federated learning (FL) is often leveraged to build models for smart healthcare applications. Existing deployed FL frameworks cannot address the key issues of varying data quality and heterogeneous data distributions across multiple institutions in this sector. In this paper, we report our experience developing and deploying the Contribution©\Aware Federated Learning (CAreFL) framework for smart healthcare. It provides an efficient and accurate approach to fairly evaluate FL participants¡¯ contributions to model performance without exposing their private data, and improves the FL model training protocol by allowing the best performing intermediate sub©\models to be distributed to participants for FL training.

2023,IEEE Data Eng. Bull.,Enhance Mono-modal Sentiment Classification with Federated Cross-modal Transfer.,"Xueyang Wu, Di Jiang, Yuanfeng Song, Qian Xu, Qiang Yang",Xueyang Wu,English,"Sentiment analysis is a complex process that involves multiple modalities, which can provide more accurate and informative results than using a single modality. Although existing multimodal approaches have shown to be superior to mono-modal sentiment classification, they are not always practical in real-world scenarios where only mono-modal input is available, or where multimodal data is limited due to data scarcity or privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that enhances mono-modal sentiment classification through federated transfer learning. Specifically, we focus on a practical industrial problem where text and speech data are owned by different affiliations, and we aim to bridge these modalities by sharing a cross-modal feature generator and phone classifier.

Federated learning, which is a distributed machine learning setting where many clients (e.g. mobile devices or organizations) train a model collaboratively while keeping the training data local, was born as a result. And it has been applied to an increasing number of business scenarios. Like traditional machine learning, federated learning methods are also very sensitive to hyperparameters. However, data privacy will be protected using cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption and secret sharing in federated learning, resulting in significant data amounts transferred among clients. Given this, we should find a more efficient method to optimize hyperparameters, which means utilizing fewer budgets (time, iterations, etc.).

In this work, we propose a novel phonetic-semantic pre-training (PSP) framework that allows a model to effectively improve the performance of ASR against practical noisy environments via seamlessly integrating pre-training, self-supervised learning, and fine-tuning. In particular, there are three fundamental stages in PSP. First, pre-train the phone-to-word transducer (PWT) to map the generated phone sequence to the target text using only unpaired text data; second, continue training the PWT on more complex data generated from an empirical phone-perturbation heuristic, in additional to self-supervised signals by recovering the tainted phones; and?¡­",Article,https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.26599/AIR.2022.9150001?via=indexdotco,0,wu2022phonetic,"pre-training,automatic speech recognition,self-supervised learning"
