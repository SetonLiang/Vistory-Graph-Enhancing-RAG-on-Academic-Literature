However, the embedding techniques are data demanding and suffer from the cold-start problem. Especially, for the cold-start item which only has limited interactions, it is hard to train a reasonable item ID embedding, called cold ID embedding, which is a major challenge for the embedding techniques. The cold item ID embedding has two main problems: (1) A gap is existing between the cold ID embedding and the deep model. (2) Cold ID embedding would be seriously affected by noisy interaction. However, most existing methods do not consider both two issues in the cold-start problem, simultaneously. To address these problems, we adopt two key ideas: (1) Speed up the model fitting for the cold item ID embedding (fast adaptation). (2) Alleviate the influence of noise. Along this line, we propose Meta Scaling and?бн",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3404835.3462843,107,zhu2021learning,"Cold-start Recommendation,Item ID Embedding,Warm Up,Meta Network"

However, there are few quantitative ways available for this assessment. Therefore, we propose a data-driven solution to assess skill value from a market-oriented perspective. Specifically, we formulate the task of job skill value assessment as a Salary-Skill Value Composition Problem, where each job position is regarded as the composition of a set of required skills attached with the contextual information of jobs, and the job salary is assumed to be jointly influenced by the context-aware value of these skills. Then, we propose an enhanced neural network with cooperative structure, namely Salary-Skill Composition Network (SSCN), to separate the job skills and measure their value based on the massive job postings.

Indeed, through course learning, many employees have the opportunity to improve their knowledge and skills. For these systems, a major issue is how to recommend learning plans, i.e., a set of courses arranged in the order they should be learned, that can help employees improve their work performance. Existing studies mainly focus on recommending courses that users are most likely to click on by capturing their learning preferences.

It then robustly detects anomalies by uncovering the underlying dependency among node pairs in terms of homophily and heterophily, two essential connection properties of GAD.

Intuitively, users' interactions with items are highly driven by their unchanging inherent intents (e.g., always preferring high-quality items) and changing demand intents (e.g., wanting a T-shirt in summer but a down jacket in winter). However, both types of intents are implicitly expressed in recommendation scenario, posing challenges in leveraging them for accurate intent-aware recommendations. Fortunately, in search scenario, often found alongside recommendation on the same online platform, users express their demand intents explicitly through their query words. Intuitively, in both scenarios, a user shares the same inherent intent and the interactions may be influenced by the same demand intent. It is therefore feasible to utilize the interaction data from both scenarios to reinforce the dual intents for joint intent-aware modeling. But the joint modeling should deal with two problems: 1) accurately modeling users' implicit demand intents in recommendation; 2) modeling the relation between the dual intents and the interactive items. To address these problems, we propose a novel model named Unified Dual-Intents Translation for joint modeling of Search and Recommendation (UDITSR).

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel SpGesture framework based on Spiking Neural Networks, which possesses several unique merits compared with existing methods: (1) Robustness: By utilizing membrane potential as a memory list, we pioneer the introduction of Source-Free Domain Adaptation into SNN for the first time. This enables SpGesture to mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by distribution shifts. (2) High Accuracy: With a novel Spiking Jaccard Attention, SpGesture enhances the SNNs' ability to represent sEMG features, leading to a notable rise in system accuracy.

However, sEMG is easily influenced by various forms of noise in real-world environments, leading to challenges in providing long-term stable interactions through sEMG.

It becomes critical for policy makers to understand the emerging dynamics of the post-pandemic labour market and provide the right policies for supporting the sustainable development of regional economies. To this end, in this paper, we provide a data-driven approach to assess and understand the evolving dynamics in regions' labour markets with large-scale online job search queries and job postings. In particular, we model the spatial-temporal patterns of labour flow and labour demand which reflect the attractiveness of regional labour markets. Our analysis shows that regional labour markets suffered from dramatic changes and demonstrated unusual signs of recovery during the pandemic. Specifically, the intention of labour flow quickly recovered with a trend of migrating from large to small cities and from northern to southern regions, respectively. Meanwhile, due to the pandemic, the demand of blue-collar workers has been substantially reduced compared to that of white-collar workers. In addition, the demand structure of blue-collar jobs also changed from manufacturing to service industries. Our findings reveal that the pandemic can cause varied impacts on regions with different structures of labour demand and control policies. This analysis provides timely information for both individuals and organizations in confronting the dynamic change in job markets during the extreme events, such as pandemics. Also, the governments can be better assisted for?бн",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00199,0,sun2023large," COVID-19 pandemic, labour market"
