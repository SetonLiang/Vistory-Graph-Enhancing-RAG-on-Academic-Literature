2022,Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems?…,From ‘wow’to ‘why’: Guidelines for creating the opening of a data video with cinematic styles,"Xian Xu, Leni Yang, David Yip, Mingming Fan, Zheng Wei, Huamin Qu",Xian Xu,English," Data videos are an increasingly popular storytelling form. The opening of a data video critically influences its success as the opening either attracts the audience to continue watching or bores them to abandon watching. However, little is known about how to create an attractive opening. We draw inspiration from the openings of famous films to facilitate designing data video openings. First, by analyzing over 200 films from several sources, we derived six primary cinematic opening styles adaptable to data videos. Then, we consulted eight experts from the film industry to formulate 28 guidelines. To validate the usability and effectiveness of the guidelines, we asked participants to create data video openings with and without the guidelines, which were then evaluated by experts and the general public. Results showed that the openings designed with the guidelines were perceived to be more attractive, and the?…",Conference paper,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501896,15,xu2022wow,"Visualization, Storytelling, Interview, Lab Study, Data Video, Guideline "
2020,Advances in Creativity,The Invisible Art of Storytelling and Media Production,David Kei-Man Yip,David Kei-Man Yip,English," As the early filmmakers were magicians, cinema has developed from the early days of visible ‘tricks’ to invisible ‘effects’ [1]. As narrative cinema is to engage the audience with the story, many of the cinematic effects have been made to look invisible to the untrained eyes and ears. Film is both magical and make-believe. Like a magician who manages to hide his or her trick in a magic act, a filmmaker often hides his or her magic tricks from the audience. The invisible art of hiding cinematic effects is one of the important skills in media production. In storytelling, the hidden subtext can be as important as the visual text. This comprehensive article discusses the invisible art of storytelling and filmmaking.",Conference paper,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-51626-0_33,6,yip2020invisible,"Art of storytelling,Cinematic arts,Creative arts,Film art,Content design ,Narrative content, Media production, Invisible editing"
2020,Advances in Creativity,Visual Elements and Design Principles in Media Production,David Kei-man Yip,David Kei-man Yip,English," Visual elements such as dot, line, plane and color are the basic components of an image. By applying design principles to these visual elements in visual expression, the creative possibilities are infinite. Cinematic style is created by the filmmaker’s control over the medium. Many visual styles of media projects are the application of the design principles to the visual elements. This systematic approach is not only confined to a shot composition but also to the whole visual structure of the work involving the development of both story and visual elements. This article analyzes this design approach to visual styles by discussing the works of several film masters as examples of how media project can use this approach to design and structure visual content.

2021,Advances in Creativity,The hidden art of transmedia storytelling across cinema and video game,David Kei-man Yip,David Kei-man Yip,English," Various forms of digital media such as computer game have borrowed greatly from cinematic art and expression in terms of its world building and narrative structure [1, 2]. Cinema and video game share similar screen, character and time-based properties. They are time-based because they have time dimension in duration and structure. Time itself is invisible and intangible. Time-based media employs the dramatic art of storytelling and content design sometimes with hidden effects invisible to untrained eyes. Despite these characteristic similarities, cinema and video game as both time and character-based media do function and entertain differently. Narrative and experience design can be invisible and relevant to the creation and experience of cinematic storytelling and video game. This article aims to offer an extended perspective of transmedia storytelling [3, 4] by discussing both the differences and also?…",Conference paper,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-80094-9_68,3,yip2021hidden,"Creative arts,Transmedia storytelling,Cinematic arts ,Visual storytelling,Game design,Narrative theory"
2020,Reconceptualizing the Digital Humanities in Asia: New Representations of Art?…,Cinematic Surrealism of the Interactive Virtual Space,David Kei-Man Yip,David Kei-Man Yip,English,"  Surrealism has been a revolutionary art movement since the early 1920s. It transcended the boundaries of previous art movements by visualizing the uncanny subconscious mind and dream. Surrealism was also very influential in the development of cinema through the creative collaboration of legendary artist Salvador Dalí and cinema masters such as Luis Bu?uel, Alfred Hitchcock, and Walt Disney. Standing on the shoulders of these giants, this 4D project built on this collaborative tradition between surreal arts and cinematic arts by adding digital arts into this fusion of cinematic surrealism. Through the use of latest VR digital technology, this project expanded the cinematic experience from the 2D screen into a 3D environment with interactivity (3?+?1D) and invited users to be “active creative dreamers” in a virtual dream designed in the style of Salvador Dalí with reference to the works of René Magritte?…",Article,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-4642-6_4,3,yip2020cinematic,None

2022,Human Factors in Communication of Design 49,Between Passive Viewing and Active Choosing in Storytelling,David Kei-Man Yip,David Kei-Man Yip,English,"Since the dawn of the Internet, abundance of content and information is constantly being created and shared at the speed of light across different media. Media technologies have given us almost unlimited access to choose and interact with vast amount of content and information. We seem to be in active control in choosing what information we want to see and interact with on the internet. Ironically, with all this interactive freedom, most of us still prefer to watch their favorite TV programs or films passively on interactive media platforms. New technologies such as streaming TV have provided many new platforms to present passive content but to what extent how these new technologies have affected the form and shape of content remains a question. Simply by looking at the ratio of programs for traditional passive viewing vs. programs with interactive content, the audience has spoken by choosing to watch conventional content passively. Interacting with content is more than just choosing what pre-made content to watch, for that we always have our remote control. Interacting with content is about having our own say or control about the outcome or direction of a story (Crawford, 2013; Roth, 2015). Unlike what many media theories have predicted many years ago, interactive narrative has not become mainstream and would never replace conventional form of storytelling. Nevertheless, as more content is being delivered on mobile or personal computer in addition to the big screen, more interactive content will be made available in the foreseeable future. Many popular 4As video games have already mixed conventional storytelling elements with some?…",Article,https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ytyVEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA65&dq=info:skATsT8kByQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_M56OQOBP5&sig=aDPeD7rfiiaNoRITfDM5Hju66aQ,2,yip2022between,"Creative arts, Cinematic arts, Cinematic storytelling, Interactive storytelling, Interactive narrative, Visual communication, Visual storytelling"
2023,Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Visual Information?…,From Expanded Cinema to Extended Reality: How AI Can Expand and Extend Cinematic Experiences,"Junrong Song, Bingyuan Wang, Zeyu Wang, David Kei-Man Yip",Junrong Song,English," This paper explores the concept of expanded cinema and its relationship to extended reality (XR), focusing on the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to expand and extend expressive possibilities. Expanded cinema refers to experimental film and multimedia art forms that challenge the conventions of traditional cinema by creating immersive and interactive experiences for audiences. XR, on the other hand, blurs the line between physical and virtual reality, offering immersive storytelling experiences. Both expanded cinema and XR aim to push the boundaries of traditional norms and create immersive experiences through the integration of technology, interactivity, and cross-sensory elements. The paper emphasizes the role of AI in optimizing 3D scene creation for XR and enhancing the overall experience through a case study.

Guidelines for Cinematic Endings in Data Videos,"Xian Xu, Aoyu Wu, Leni Yang, Zheng Wei, Rong Huang, David Yip, Huamin Qu",Xian Xu,English," Data videos are becoming increasingly popular in society and academia. Yet little is known about how to create endings that strengthen a lasting impression and persuasion. To fulfill the gap, this work aims to develop guidelines for data video endings by drawing inspiration from cinematic arts. To contextualize cinematic endings in data videos, 111 film endings and 105 data video endings are first analyzed to identify four common styles using the framework of ending punctuation marks. ?We conducted expert interviews (N=11) and formulated 20 guidelines for creating cinematic endings in data videos. To validate our guidelines, we conducted a user study where 24 participants were invited to design endings with and without our guidelines, which are evaluated by experts and the general public.

2022,Human Factors in Communication of Design 49,Disruptive Innovations in Cinematic Storytelling from 2D to 3D,David Kei-Man Yip,David Kei-Man Yip,English,"Long before the digital revolution, communication theorist Marshall McLuhan has taught us about how the different forms of media can shape content with his famous book Medium is the Message (McLuhan et al. 1967). Over the past several decades, the theory has certainly stood the test of time. New media technologies have advanced so rapidly that many news form of content creation and expression have been made possible. New tools have offered new and diverse forms of storytelling. Nevertheless, new ways can never completely replace old ways; they just evolve and build upon the conventional practices. Do some of the new digital tools simply offer new way of doing the old thing with better technology or are they completely change the old way entirely? This paper aims to examine these issues from a historical perspective on a few past innovation disruptions that sent destructive shockwave to how things were in the beginning but brought new heights in the long run.

2023,arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.01067,Painterly Reality: Enhancing Audience Experience with Paintings through Interactive Art,"Aven Le Zhou, Kang Zhang, David Yip",Aven Le Zhou,English,"Perceiving paintings entails more than merely engaging the audience's eyes and brains; their perceptions and experiences of a painting can be intricately connected with body movement. This paper proposes an interactive art approach entitled ""Painterly Reality"" that facilitates the perception and interaction with paintings in a three-dimensional manner. Its objective is to promote bodily engagement with the painting (i.e., embedded body embodiment and its movement and interaction) to enhance the audience's experience, while maintaining its essence. Unlike two-dimensional interactions, this approach constructs the Painterly Reality by capturing the audience's body embodiment in real-time and embedding into a three-dimensional painterly world derived from a given painting input. Through their body embodiment, the audience can navigate the painterly world and play with the magical realism (i.e., interactive painterly objects), fostering meaningful experiences via interactions. The Painterly Reality is subsequently projected through an Augmented Reality Mirror as a live painting and displayed in front of the audience. Hence, the audience can gain enhanced experiences through bodily engagement while simultaneously viewing and appreciating the live painting. The paper implements the proposed approach as an interactive artwork, entitled ""Everyday Conjunctive,"" with Fong Tse Ka's painting and installs in a local museum, which successfully enhances audience experience through bodily engagement.",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01067,0,zhou2023painterly,"Chinese Comic Painting, FONG Tse Ka, Bodily Engagement, Bodily Movement, Body Embodiment, Interactive Art"

However, this article argues otherwise. This article discusses the misconceptions of LED-based XR as the sum of AR, VR and MR. Although MR is still the combined form of AR and VR, their focuses are different from the LED-based XR. While the common features of AR, VR and MR mostly focus on the different treatments of environment as reality, their limitations lay on their inability to integrate real-time high resolution video of human figures.

Since the first generation of smartphones, many of the most popular applications have been mobile games, with base defence games among the favourites, particularly with the implementation of real-time Player vs. Player (PvP) features. To protect their bases, gamers must not only strategically place their defence weapons in the base to guard against unpredictable attack and looting, but also launch attacks to loot others’ bases for upgrades. Each base houses necessities collected from lootings and upgrades, and also provides a personal space for the individual gamer’s creative expression and visual statement.
