We have created various computer-mediated virtual environments including social networks, video conferencing, virtual 3D worlds (e.g., VR Chat), augmented reality applications (e.g., Pokemon Go), and Non-Fungible Token Games (e.g., Upland). Such virtual environments, albeit non-perpetual and unconnected, have bought us various degrees of digital transformation. The term `metaverse' has been coined to further facilitate the digital transformation in every aspect of our physical lives. At the core of the metaverse stands the vision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent, and shared realm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital `big bang' of our cyberspace is not far away. This survey paper presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the digital `big bang'. First, technologies are the enablers that drive the transition from the current Internet to the metaverse. We thus examine eight enabling technologies rigorously - Extended Reality, User Interactivity (Human-Computer Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer Vision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks. In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm.

Edge network emerges as the times require. Data processing on the edge nodes can reduce the delay of data transmission and improve the response speed. In recent years, the need for artificial intelligence of edge network has been proposed. However, the data of a single, individual edge node is limited and does not satisfy the conditions of machine learning. Therefore, performing edge network machine learning under the premise of data confidentiality became a research hotspot. This paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Asynchronous Federated Learning Mechanism for Edge Network Computing (PAFLM), which can allow multiple edge nodes to achieve more efficient federated learning without sharing their private data.

The deployment of IoT encounters several challenges, such as difficulties in controlling and managing IoT applications and networks, problems in programming existing IoT devices, long service provisioning time, underused resources, as well as complexity, isolation and scalability, among others. One fundamental concern is that current IoT networks lack flexibility and intelligence. A network-wide flexible control and management are missing in IoT networks. In addition, huge numbers of devices and large amounts of data are involved in IoT, but none of them have been tuned for supporting network management and control. In this paper, we argue that Software-defined Networking (SDN) together with the data generated by IoT applications can enhance the control and management of IoT in terms of flexibility and intelligence. We present a review for the evolution of SDN and IoT and analyze the benefits and challenges brought by the integration of SDN and IoT with the help of IoT data.

Methods and findings Population and COVID-19 epidemiological data between 21st January 2020 to 15th November 2020 from 216 countries and territories were included with the implemented public health interventions. We used deep reinforcement learning, and the algorithm was trained to enable agents to try to find optimal public health strategies that maximized total reward on controlling the spread of COVID-19. The results suggested by the algorithm were analyzed against the actual timing and intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Early implementations of the actual lockdown and travel restriction policies, usually at the time of local index case were associated with less burden of COVID-19. In contrast, our agent suggested to initiate at least minimal intensity of lockdown or travel restriction even before or on the day of the index case in each country and territory. In addition, the agent mostly recommended a combination of lockdown and travel restrictions and higher intensity policies than the policies implemented by governments, but did not always encourage rapid full lockdown and full border closures. The limitation of this study was that it was done with incomplete data due to the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, inconsistent testing and reporting.

Therefore, 5G MEC could enable excellent user experience in applications like Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), which are computation-intensive, and delay and jitter-sensitive. However, existing 5G handoff algorithms often do not consider the computational load of MEC servers, are too complex for real-time execution, or do not integrate easily with the standard protocol stack. Thus they can impair the performance of 5G MEC. To address this gap, we propose Comp-HO, a handoff algorithm that finds a local solution to the joint problem of optimizing signal strength and computational load. Additionally, Comp-HO can easily be integrated into current LTE and 5G base stations thanks to its simplicity and standard-friendly deployability. Specifically, we evaluate Comp-HO through a custom NS-3 simulator which we calibrate via MAR prototype measurements from a real-world 5G testbed. We simulate both Comp-HO and several classic handoff algorithms. The results show that, even without a global optimum, the proposed algorithm still significantly reduces the number of large delays, caused by congestion at MECs, at the expense of a small increase in transmission delay.",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00256,23,zhou20215g,None

Question Pool websites (QPs) such as LeetCode, Code Chef, and Math Playground help PBL by supplying authentic, diverse, and contextualized questions to students. Nonetheless, empirical findings suggest that 40% to 80% of students registered in QPs drop out in less than two months.

Adopting a data-driven approach, we identify five different engagement moods for QP students, which are namely challenge-seeker, subject-seeker, interest-seeker, joy-seeker, and non-seeker. We find that students have collective preferences for answering questions in each engagement mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping out significantly.

Nowadays, most caching systems store data with a high programming voltage corresponding to the largest possible ‘expiry date’, typically on the order of years, which maximizes the cache damage. However, popular videos rarely exhibit lifecycles longer than a couple of months. Consequently, the programming voltage can instead be adapted to fit the lifecycle and mitigate the cache damage accordingly. In this paper, we propose LiA-cache, a Lifecycle-Aware caching policy for online videos.

Consequently, conventional adaptive streaming methodologies often find themselves unsatisfactory to meet the requirements in threefold: 1) current algorithms reuse existing quality of experience (QoE) definitions while overlooking the unique features of point cloud video thus failing to provide optimal user experience, 2) most deep learning approaches require long-span data collections to learn sufficiently varied network conditions and result in long training periods and capacity occupation, 3) cloud training approaches pose privacy risks caused by leakage of user reported service usage and networking conditions. To overcome the limitations, we present FRAS, the first federated reinforcement learning framework, to the best of our knowledge, for adaptive point cloud video streaming. We define a new QoE model which takes the unique features of point cloud video into account. Each client uses reinforcement learning (RL) to train video quality selection with the objective of optimizing the user's QoE under multiple constraints. Then, a federated learning framework is integrated with the RL algorithm to enhance training performance with privacy preservation.

However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to capture such an important property. To make GNN aware of automorphic equivalence, we first introduce a localized variant of this concept---ego-centered automorphic equivalence (Ego-AE). Then, we design a novel variant of GNN, ie, GRAPE, that uses learnable AE-aware aggregators to explicitly differentiate the Ego-AE of each node's neighbors with the aids of various subgraph templates. While the design of subgraph templates can be hard, we further propose a genetic algorithm to automatically search them from graph data. Moreover, we theoretically prove that GRAPE is expressive in terms of generating distinct representations for nodes with different Ego-AE features, which fills in a fundamental gap of existing GNN variants.

In 2D user interfaces, users typically use a rectangle selection tool to formulate a region using a mouse or touchpad. Region selection in 3D spaces, especially in Augmented Reality (AR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) is different and challenging because users need to select an intended region via freehand mid-air gestures or eye-based actions that are touchless interactions. In this work, we aim to fill in the gap in the design of region selection techniques in AR HMDs. We first analyzed and discretized the interaction procedure of region selection and explored design possibilities for each step. We then developed four techniques for region selection in AR HMDs, which leveraged users' hand and gaze for unimodal or multimodal interaction. The techniques were evaluated via a user study with a controlled region selection task.

To address this issue, some CQAs have developed their own special promotional gamification schemes to incentivize users to maintain their contributions throughout the holiday season. These promotional gamification schemes are often time-limited, optional, and run alongside the default gamification schemes of their websites. However, the impact of such promotional gamification schemes on user behavior remains largely unexplored in the existing literature.

However, it faces challenges including statistical heterogeneity of clients' datasets and resource constraints of client devices, which severely impact the training performance and user experience. Prior works have tackled these challenges by combining personalization with model compression schemes including quantization and pruning. However, the pruning is data-dependent and thus must be done on the client side which requires considerable computation cost. Moreover, the pruning normally trains a binary supermask  which significantly limits the model capacity yet with no computation benefit. Consequently, the training requires high computation cost and a long time to converge while the model performance does not pay off. In this work, we propose HideNseek which employs one-shot data-agnostic pruning at initialization to get a subnetwork based on weights' synaptic saliency. Each client then optimizes a sign supermask  multiplied by the unpruned weights to allow faster convergence with the same compression rates as state-of-the-art. Empirical results from three datasets demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art, HideNseek improves inferences accuracies by up to 40.6\% while reducing the communication cost and training time by up to 39.7\% and 46.8\% respectively.",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04385,9,vallapuram2022hidenseek,None

As such, they meet the current interest in softwarization and network programmability that fuels the need for improved network automation in agile infrastructures, including edge and fog environments. Network design and optimization for AI/ML applications addresses the complementary topic of supporting AI/ML-based systems through novel networking techniques, including new architectures and algorithms. The third topic area is system implementation and open-source software development. This evolution draws particular attention to interdisciplinary approaches. Researchers in communication networks apply ML and AI concepts to optimize and automate network architecture, control, and management.

However, in 2023, skepticism surfaced within industrial and academic spheres, raising concerns that excitement may outpace actual technological progress. Interoperability, recognized as a major barrier to the Metaverse's full potential, is central to this debate. CoinMarketCap's report in February 2023 indicated that of over 240 metaverse initiatives, most existed in isolation, underscoring the interoperability challenge. Despite consensus on its critical role, there is a research gap in exploring the impact on the Metaverse, significance, and developmental extent. Our study bridges this gap via a systematic literature review and content analysis of the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, yielding 74 publications after a rigorous selection process. Interoperability, difficult to define due to varied contexts and lack of standardization, is central to the Metaverse, often seen as a digital ecosystem. Urs Gasser's framework from Harvard Law School, outlining technological, data, human, and institutional dimensions, systematically addresses interoperability complexities.

They enhance visual quality in central gaze regions and reduce it in the periphery. However, bandwidth variation may hinder the provision of smooth VR gaming experiences. We present FovOptix, a system that combines FR with adaptive FVE to deliver video stream at a lower yet adaptive bitrate while not compromising the perceived video quality. FovOptix is based on a game-agnostic open-source to ensure reproducibility and compatibility with various games.

While previous studies either depended on small-scale surveys or focused on the response to initial lockdowns, this paper uses large-scale location service data to systematically analyze the urban mobility behavior changes across three distinct phases of the pandemic, ie, pre-pandemic, lockdown, and reopen. Our analyses reveal two typical patterns that govern the mobility behavior changes in most urban venues: daily life-centered urban venues go through smaller mobility drops during the lockdown and more rapid recovery after reopening, while work-centered urban venues suffer from more significant mobility drops that are likely to persist even after reopening. Such mobility behavior changes exert deeper impacts on the underlying social fabric, where the level of mobility reduction is positively correlated with the experienced segregation at that urban venue. Therefore, urban venues undergoing more mobility reduction are also more filled with people from homogeneous socio-demographic backgrounds. Moreover, mobility behavior changes display significant heterogeneity across geographical regions, which can be largely explained by the partisan inclination at the state level. Our study shows the vast potential of location service data in deriving a timely and comprehensive understanding of the social dynamic in urban space, which is valuable for informing the gradual transition back to the normal lifestyle in a “post-pandemic era”.",Article,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/22132,1,chen2023getting,None

Therefore, a proper transport protocol is crucial to minimise transmission latency and ensure sufficient throughput to support MAR performance. Relatedly, 5G, a potential MAR supporting technology, is widely believed to be smarter, faster, and more efficient than its predecessors. However, the suitability and performance of existing transport protocols in MAR in the 5G context has not been explored.

We confirm that the invasion stimulates discussion in the observed communities, accompanied by an increased volume of partisan news sharing. Next, we characterize users' response to such sharing. We observe that partisan bias plays a role in narrowing its propagation. More biased media is less likely to be spread across multiple subreddits. However, we find that partisan news sharing attracts more users to engage in the discussion, by generating more comments. We then built a predictive model to identify users likely to spread partisan news. The prediction is challenging though, with 61.57% accuracy on average.

This paper aims to explore a historical analysis of this shift. We provide anecdotal evidence of new trends, potential impact, and challenges. We discuss the usage of AIGC in political campaigns, and how AIGC is used as a substitute for incarcerated politicians. Such a usage presents novel ways for leaders to reach the public and keep them politically active. However, AIGC also has risks when used for disinformation, such as DeepFake media and caller bots, to undermine and malign the opponents.

This representation is now commonly used in 3D reconstruction tasks relying on cameras and LiDARs. However, fusing data from these two types of sensors is poorly performed in many existing frameworks, leading to unsatisfactory mapping results, mainly due to inaccurate camera poses. This paper presents OmniColor, a novel and efficient algorithm to colorize point clouds using an independent 360-degree camera. Given a LiDAR-based point cloud and a sequence of panorama images with initial coarse camera poses, our objective is to jointly optimize the poses of all frames for mapping images onto geometric reconstructions. Our pipeline works in an off-the-shelf manner that does not require any feature extraction or matching process. Instead, we find optimal poses by directly maximizing the photometric consistency of LiDAR maps. In experiments, we show that our method can overcome the severe visual distortion of omnidirectional images and greatly benefit from the wide field of view (FOV) of 360-degree cameras to reconstruct various scenarios with accuracy and stability.

It thus brings us to a technical challenge: `How to allow the users to freely create diverse and immersive virtual scenes from a narrow FoV image with a specified viewport?' To this end, we propose a transformer-based 360 image outpainting framework called Dream360, which can generate diverse, high-fidelity, and high-resolution panoramas from user-selected viewports, considering the spherical properties of 360 images. Compared with existing methods, e.g., [3], which primarily focus on inputs with rectangular masks and central locations while overlooking the spherical property of 360 images, our Dream360 offers higher outpainting flexibility and fidelity based on the spherical representation. Dream360 comprises two key learning stages: (I) codebook-based panorama outpainting via Spherical-VQGAN (S-VQGAN), and (II) frequency-aware refinement with a novel frequency-aware consistency loss. Specifically, S-VQGAN learns a sphere-specific codebook from spherical harmonic (SH) values, providing a better representation of spherical data distribution for scene modeling. The frequency-aware refinement matches the resolution and further improves the semantic consistency and visual fidelity of the generated results.

2023,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,Learn to Optimize the Constrained Shortest Paths on Large Dynamic Graphs,"Jiaming Yin, Weixiong Rao, Qinpei Zhao, Chenxi Zhang, Pan Hui",Jiaming Yin,English,"The constrained shortest path (  ) problem has wide applications in travel path planning, mobile video broadcasting and network routing. Existing works do not work well on large dynamic graphs and suffer from either ineffectiveness or low scalability issues. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose an efficient and effective solution framework, namely   . The solution framework includes two key components: (1) the techniques to decompose a large    instance into multiple small sub-instances and (2) the developed learning model    to solve small    instances. The evaluation result on real road network graphs indicates that our approach    performs well on large dynamic graphs by rather high quality and reasonable running time, and particularly adapt to significant graph changes even with broken edges.

The dataset consists of many data points collected from diverse participants, including physiological responses (EDA and Heart Rate) and self-reported cybersickness symptoms. The paper will provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the arranged navigation task, the data collection procedures, and the data format. The dataset will serve as a valuable resource for researchers to develop and evaluate predictive models for cybersickness and will facilitate more research in cybersickness mitigation.",Article,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13527,0,wang2023dataset,None
2022,2022 IEEE 24th Int Conf on High Performance Computing & Communications; 8th?…,Fairness-Aware Algorithms for Seed Allocation in Social Advertising,"Pengzi Wang, Yiming Zhu, Kai Han, Zhizhuo Yin, Qing Xiu, Pan Hui",Pengzi Wang,English,"As a crucial and widely researched application in social networks, social advertising refers to selecting seed users for several advertisers to propagate their advertisements in the network via a information cascade effect. Prior studies on this topic have presented approximation algorithms merely for maximizing the expected revenue. However, regarding to the fairness issue, no existing works have provided effective solution. Such a issue would cause polarized revenues among different advertisers and the draining of them. In this paper, we investigate the fairness issue in social advertising. That is, how the social network platform owner distributes seeds users fairly to different advertisers. We define the fairness metric according to the maximin share, a concept about fair distribution in computation economics, and develop a novel approximation algorithm. Our approach achieves an approximation factor of   , where  ?…",Conference paper,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10074923/,0,wang2022fairness,"Social network, influence propagation, fair allocation, approximation algorithms"

To better safeguard the privacy of user data, traditional ML techniques have transitioned toward new paradigms like federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL). However, existing frameworks have overlooked device heterogeneity, greatly hindering their applicability in practice. In order to address such limitations, we developed a framework based on both FL and SL to share the training load of the discriminative part of a GAN to different client devices. We make our framework available as open-source software1.",Article,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665963822001208,0,liang2022federated,"Federated learning,Split learning,GAN,Hardware heterogeneous,Privacy preservation"
2022,Applied Sciences,Intelligent Decision Making Based on the Combination of Deep Reinforcement Learning and an Influence Map,"Xiaofeng Lu, Ao Xue, Pietro Lio, Pan Hui",Xiaofeng Lu,English,"Almost all recent deep reinforcement learning algorithms use four consecutive frames as the state space to retain the dynamic information. If the training state data constitute an image, the state space is used as the input of the neural network for training. As an AI-assisted decision-making technology, a dynamic influence map can describe dynamic information. In this paper, we propose the use of a frame image superimposed with an influence map as the state space to express dynamic information. Herein, we optimize Ape-x as a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm. Sparse reward is an issue that must be solved in refined intelligent decision making. The use of an influence map is proposed to generate the intrinsic reward when there is no external reward. The experiments conducted in this study prove that the combination of a dynamic influence map and deep reinforcement learning is effective. Compared with the traditional method that uses four consecutive frames to represent dynamic information, the score of the proposed method is increased by 11–13%, the training speed is increased by 59%, the video memory consumption is reduced by 30%, and the memory consumption is reduced by 50%. The proposed method is compared with the Ape-x algorithm without an influence map, DQN, N-Step DQN, QR-DQN, Dueling DQN, and C51. The experimental results show that the final score of the proposed method is higher than that of the compared baseline methods. In addition, the influence map is used to generate an intrinsic reward to effectively resolve the sparse reward problem.",Article,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/22/11458,0,lu2022intelligent,"reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, inﬂuence map, sparse reward"

Therefore, efficient strategies for medical resource allocation are urgently needed. However, conventional rule-based methods employed by public health experts have limited capability in dealing with the complex and dynamic pandemic-spreading situation. In addition, model-based optimization methods such as dynamic programming (DP) fail to work since we cannot obtain a precise model in real-world situations most of the time. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for decision-making; however, three key challenges exist in solving this problem via RL: (1) complex situations and countless choices for decision-making in the real world; (2) imperfect information due to the latency of pandemic spreading; and (3) limitations on conducting experiments in the real world since we?…",Article,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3552436,0,hao2022hierarchical,"Hierarchical reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, medical resource allocation, imperfect information, COVID-19 pandemic"
