2020,proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence,Tensor completion for weakly-dependent data on graph for metro passenger flow prediction,"Ziyue Li, Nurettin Dorukhan Sergin, Hao Yan, Chen Zhang, Fugee Tsung",Ziyue Li,English,"Low-rank tensor decomposition and completion have attracted significant interest from academia given the ubiquity of tensor data. However, low-rank structure is a global property, which will not be fulfilled when the data presents complex and weak dependencies given specific graph structures. One particular application that motivates this study is the spatiotemporal data analysis. As shown in the preliminary study, weakly dependencies can worsen the low-rank tensor completion performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition and completion framework by introducing the L 1-norm penalty and Graph Laplacian penalty to model the weakly dependency on graph. We further propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Block Coordinate Descent for efficient estimation. A case study based on the metro passenger flow data in Hong Kong is conducted to demonstrate an improved performance over the regular tensor completion methods.",Article,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5915,55,li2020tensor,low-rank tensor decomposition and completion

While multivariate statistical process control (SPC) has been receiving increasing attention, existing methods are often inadequate as they are sensitive to the parametric model assumptions of multivariate data. In this paper, we propose a novel, nonparametric k-nearest neighbours empirical cumulative sum (KNN-ECUSUM) control chart that is a machine-learning-based black-box control chart for monitoring multivariate data by utilising extensive historical data under both in-control and out-of-control scenarios.

2020,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,Long-short term spatiotemporal tensor prediction for passenger flow profile,"Ziyue Li, Hao Yan, Chen Zhang, Fugee Tsung",Ziyue Li,English,"Spatiotemporal data are very common in many applications, such as manufacturing systems and transportation systems. Given the intrinsic complex spatial and temporal correlations of such data, short-term and long-term prediction for spatiotemporal data is often very challenging. Most of the traditional statistical models fail to preserve innate features in data alongside their complex correlations. In this paper, we focus on a tensor-based prediction method and propose several practical techniques to improve both long-term and short-term prediction accuracy. For long-term prediction, we propose the “tensor decomposition + 2-Dimensional Auto-Regressive Moving Average (2D-ARMA)” model, and an effective way to update prediction in real-time; For short-term prediction, we propose to conduct tensor completion based on tensor clustering to avoid oversimplification and ensure accuracy.

An efficient approach to improving the shape accuracy of a fabricated product is to compensate the fabrication errors of AM systems by modifying the input shape defined by a digital design model. In contrast with mass production, AM processes typically fabricate customized products with extremely low volume and huge shape varieties, which makes shape accuracy control in AM a challenging problem. In this article, we propose a hybrid transfer learning framework to predict and compensate the in-plane shape deviations of new and untried freeform products based on a small number of previously fabricated products. Within this framework, the shape deviation is decomposed into a shape-independent error and a shape-specific error.

In fact, there is still room for the improvement of the early detection performance by exploiting fully the information given by fault directions. To this end, this article proposes a novel directional PCA (diPCA) approach. First, by narrowing down faults to a specified direction or composite mutually orthogonal directions, diPCA can speed fault detection and facilitate accurate fault diagnosis. It also has good theoretical properties that guarantee concise control limits.

The traditional statistical process control (SPC), however, lacks efficacy in current high-variety low-volume industrial practices since the historical reference data in Phase I are usually too scarce to infer the in-control process parameters accurately. To solve this ‘small data’ challenge, a novel Bayesian process monitoring scheme via transfer learning is proposed to facilitate a cross-product data sharing. In particular, a joint prior distribution is taken to explicitly capture the relatedness between the process data of two similar products, through which the process information can be transferred from one product (source domain) to improve the Bayesian inference for the other product (target domain).

Borrowing the name from the recommender system, we call this process a cold-start process. The sparsity of anomaly, the deviation of the profile, and noise aggravate the detection difficulty. Transfer learning could help to detect anomalies for cold-start processes by transferring the knowledge from more experienced processes to the new processes.

The corresponding optimization algorithms are also given, in which adjacent identifiable designs are produced sequentially by using track substitution until the space-filling property has been optimized.

Existing GNNs are not specified for attribute-incomplete graphs, making missing attribute imputation a burning issue. Until recently, many works notice that GNNs are coupled with spectral concentration, which means the spectrum obtained by GNNs concentrates on a local part in spectral domain, eg, low-frequency due to oversmoothing issue. As a consequence, GNNs may be seriously flawed for reconstructing graph attributes as graph spectral concentration tends to cause a low imputation precision. In this work, we present a regularized graph autoencoder for graph attribute imputation, named MEGAE, which aims at mitigating spectral concentration problem by maximizing the graph spectral entropy. Notably, we first present the method for estimating graph spectral entropy without the eigen-decomposition of Laplacian matrix and provide the theoretical upper error bound. A maximum entropy regularization then acts in the latent space, which directly increases the graph spectral entropy.

In a road network of multiple intersections, different intersections can only have someoverlapping and distinct variables observed. For example, a signalized intersection has traffic light-related variables, whereas unsignalized ones do not.

To support policy-makers, multiple studies have first modelled human mobility via macro indicators (eg, average daily travel distance) and then study the effectiveness of NPIs. In this work, we focus on mobility modelling and, from a micro perspective, aim to predict locations that will be visited by COVID-19 cases. Since NPIs generally cause economic and societal loss, such a prediction benefits governments when they design and evaluate them. However, in real-world situations, strict privacy data protection regulations result in severe data sparsity problems (ie, limited case and location information). To address these challenges and jointly model variables including a geometric graph, a set of diffusions and a set of locations, we propose a model named Deep Graph Diffusion Infomax (DGDI). We show the maximization of DGDI can be bounded by two tractable components: a univariate Mutual Information (MI) between geometric graph and diffusion representation, and a univariate MI between diffusion representation and location representation. To facilitate the research of COVID-19 prediction, we present two benchmarks that contain geometric graphs and location histories of COVID-19 cases.

Our motivating example is from subway passenger flow modeling, where similarities between stations are commonly found. However, the challenges lie in the innate high-dimensionality of tensors and also the potential existence of anomalies. This is because the three tasks, i.e., dimension reduction, clustering, and anomaly decomposition, are inter-correlated to each other, and treating them in a separate manner will render a suboptimal performance. Thus, in this work, we design a tensor-based subspace clustering and anomaly decomposition technique for simultaneously outlier-robust dimension reduction and clustering for high-dimensional tensors. To achieve this, a novel low-rank robust subspace clustering decomposition model is proposed by combining Tucker decomposition, sparse anomaly decomposition, and subspace clustering. An effective algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent is proposed to update the parameters. Prudent experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework via the simulation study, with a gain of +25% clustering accuracy than benchmark methods in a hard case.

The effect of optimization method was illustrated by numerical simulations of three optimized Shewhart, CUSUM and EWMA control charts, and a real data example.",Article,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02331888.2023.2258249,0,han2023optimization,"Optimization of control chart, change-point detection, finite samples"
2022,2022 IEEE 18th International Conference on Automation Science and?…,Attention-based Representation Learning for Time Series with Principal and Residual Space Monitoring,"Botao Wang, Fugee Tsung, Hao Yan",Botao Wang,English,"The encoder-decoder network is one of the most common deep learning models for time series representation learning and anomaly detection. However, it is hard to reconstruct time series, which is complex, correlated, and lacking in common patterns. In this paper, we apply the attention mechanism to rescale convolution layers and learn representation in the principal and the residual space. To avoid the reconstruction process, we define the residual space by the omitted segments according to the attention score in the encoder. We introduce the temporal information inside the token level and use sparse penalty to improve representation learning. We apply the proposed model to anomaly classification and fault detection experiments on two datasets, i.e. multivariate bearing fault dataset and UCRArchive profile dataset. The result shows that the representation learned by the proposed model is more likely to?…",Conference paper,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9926721/,0,wang2022attention,"anomaly detection, representation learning, attention mechanism, time series, residual space"
2022,arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.12933,Latent Augmentation Improves Graph Self-Supervised Learning,"Jiashun Cheng, Man Li, Jia Li, Fugee Tsung",Jiashun Cheng,English,"Graph self-supervised learning has been vastly employed to learn representations from unlabeled graphs. Existing methods can be roughly divided into predictive learning and contrastive learning, where the latter one attracts more research attention with better empirical performance. We argue that, however, predictive models weaponed with latent augmentations and powerful decoder could achieve comparable or even better representation power than contrastive models. In this work, we introduce data augmentations into latent space for superior generalization and better efficiency. A novel graph decoder named Wiener Graph Deconvolutional Network is correspondingly designed to perform information reconstruction from augmented latent representations. Theoretical analysis proves the superior reconstruction ability of graph wiener filter. Extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",Article,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11533620214609399853&hl=en&oi=scholarr,0,cheng2022latent,"latent augmentation,graph self-supervised learning"
