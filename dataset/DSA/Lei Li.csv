As the business expands, scalability becomes a severe issue. Instead of simply deploying more servers to cope with the quickly increasing query number, batch shortest path algorithms have been proposed recently to answer a set of queries together using shareable computation. Besides, they can also work in a highly dynamic environment as no index is needed. However, the existing batch algorithms either assume the batch queries are finely decomposed or just process them without differentiation, resulting in poor query efficiency. In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of batch shortest path algorithms by revisiting the problem of query clustering.

Specifically, we first analyze the structural stability of the index in dynamic road networks which enables us to concentrate on label value maintenance.

The main bottleneck is to deal with a large amount of partial skyline paths, which further makes the existing index-based methods incapable to obtain the complete exact skyline paths. In this paper, we propose a novel skyline path concatenation approach to avoid the expensive skyline path search, which is then used to efficiently construct a 2-hop labeling index for the CSP queries.

Since real-life networks evolve as time passes, the Dynamic Shortest Path (DSP) problem has drawn lots of attention in recent years. However, as DSP has many factors related to network topology, update patterns, and query characteristics, existing works only test their algorithms on limited situations without sufficient comparisons with other approaches. Thus, it is still hard to choose the most suitable method in practice. To this end, we first identify the determinant dimensions and constraint dimensions of the DSP problem and create a complete problem space to cover all possible situations. Then we evaluate the state-of-the-art DSP methods under the same implementation standard and test them systematically under a set of synthetic dynamic networks.

As the users’ trajectories are widely obtainable due to the ubiquity of positioning devices, the contact tracing can be achieved by examining trajectories of confirmed patients to identify other trajectories that are contacted either directly or indirectly. In this paper, we propose a generalised Trajectory Contact Search (TCS) query, which models the contact tracing problem as well as other similar trajectory-based problems. In addition, we answer the query by proposing an iterative algorithm that finds contacted trajectories progressively along the transmission chains, and we further optimise each iteration in terms of time and space efficiency by proposing a hop scanning algorithm and a grid-based time interval tree.

To tackle such difficulty, we adopt the framework of GLAD and develop an advanced index structure to support efficient fastest travel cost query on time-dependent road network.
